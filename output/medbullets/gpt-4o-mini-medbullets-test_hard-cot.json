        "question": "A 64-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a headache and nausea. He reports that he was rocking his grandson to sleep when the symptoms began. He states the pain is constant and is primarily located on his right side. When asked to indicate the area of pain, he says that it surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/91 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient\u2019s right eye is shown in Figure A. Upon physical examination, the right pupil is minimally responsive to light and the globe feels firm. A right-sided carotid bruit is appreciated. Which of the following is the most appropriate prophylaxis for this patient\u2019s condition?",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden-onset unilateral vision loss and an orbitofrontal headache with a dilated pupil and a hard ocular globe suggesting a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",
        "raw_response": "To approach this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and clinical findings of the patient step-by-step.\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with a headache, nausea, and difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which is associated with excessive tearing. The headache is localized to the right side, particularly around the eye and forehead. The firm globe and minimally responsive pupil suggest a possible ocular emergency.\n\n2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The right eye is firm, and the pupil is minimally responsive to light. These findings are suggestive of increased intraocular pressure, which is characteristic of acute glaucoma (specifically, acute angle-closure glaucoma).\n\n3. **Carotid Bruit**: The presence of a carotid bruit may indicate vascular issues, but in the context of the eye symptoms, it is less relevant to the immediate management of the suspected acute glaucoma.\n\n4. **Prophylaxis**: The question asks for the most appropriate prophylaxis for this patient's condition. Acute angle-closure glaucoma can be precipitated by certain factors, and prophylactic treatment is often aimed at preventing future episodes.\n\n5. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) **Acetazolamide**: This is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces intraocular pressure and is used in the treatment of acute glaucoma, but it is not typically used for prophylaxis.\n   - (B) **Amitriptyline**: This is an antidepressant and is not relevant to glaucoma.\n   - (C) **Clopidogrel**: This is an antiplatelet medication and is not relevant to glaucoma.\n   - (D) **Epinephrine**: This is used in anaphylaxis and for certain types of cardiac arrest, not for glaucoma.\n   - (E) **Verapamil**: This is a calcium channel blocker that can be used for migraine prophylaxis and certain cardiovascular conditions, but it is not a standard prophylactic treatment for glaucoma.\n\nGiven the context of the patient's symptoms and the need for prophylaxis against future episodes of acute angle-closure glaucoma, the most appropriate choice is **Acetazolamide (A)**, as it can help lower intraocular pressure and prevent future attacks.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n**A**",

She presented with similar symptoms 6 weeks ago and was treated for an Escherchia coli infection. She also was treated for a urinary tract infection 10 weeks ago. Her mother says that last night her daughter felt ill, and her condition has been worsening. Her daughter experienced a severe headache and had a stiff neck. This morning she was minimally responsive, vomited several times, and produced a small amount of dark cloudy urine. The patient was born at 39 weeks and met all her developmental milestones. She is currently up to date on her vaccinations and did not have infections during early childhood.

This abnormal concentration of infections when the patient is with her mother suggests a diagnosis of intentional contamination.\n\nFactitious disorder by proxy (formerly Munchausen syndrome) occurs when 1 individual creates symptoms in another for attention. Typically, this is a parent feigning or creating symptoms in a child in order to receive the psychiatric gain of attention from healthcare personnel. The patient should be treated and removed from the parents as this is considered child abuse. Factitious disorder by proxy should be suspected in any pediatric patient who has repeat infections that are atypical or not expected epidemiologically. Patients should also be evaluated for organic causes of symptoms such as immunodeficiency syndromes.\n\nAbeln and Love review the evidence regarding the diagnosis of factitious disorder by proxy. They discuss how these disorders have high morbidity and mortality when not accurately recognized. They recommend paying attention to red flags such as abnormal constellations of symptoms.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Gastroenteritis would present with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; however, it would not present with sepsis routinely. Gastroenteritis does not best explain the most likely underlying cause of this patient's presentation.\n\nAnswer B: Immunodeficiency such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) would present with lifelong infections from birth that are bacterial, viral, and fungal. Immunodeficiency would not present with repeat infections in a pediatric patient only when they are with one patient.\n\nAnswer D: Meningitis would present with headache, altered mental status, and meningeal signs. In the setting of repeat sepsis in a healthy pediatric patient, intentional contamination is more likely. Similarly, an absence of photophobia and no further history/physical exam supporting this diagnosis suggests an alternative diagnosis.\n\nAnswer E: Urinary tract infection would present with dysuria rather than repeat episodes of sepsis. Though a urinary tract infection could lead to sepsis, this would be rare and more likely to occur in an immunosuppressed patient, the elderly, or a neonate. UTIs are a common cause of infection and fever in pediatric patients.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFactitious disorder by proxy occurs when 1 individual feigns or creates symptoms in another.",

He was outside tending to his lawn for several hours in the heat, when he stood up suddenly from pulling weeds and fainted. He denies any preceding symptoms and returned to baseline within 1 minute. The patient is not aware of any medical problems and just started seeing a primary care physician last week. He recently used a friend's prescription for ondansetron for nausea. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg, pulse is 107/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals intact cranial nerves, normal strength and sensation, and a stable gait. His abdomen is soft and nontender. An ECG is performed as seen in Figure A.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after syncope, likely secondary to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension given his outdoor gardening in the heat and symptoms when standing up rapidly. The patient\u2019s ECG reveals deep, pathologic Q waves, which in this case are an incidental finding indicative of a previous myocardial infarction or a previous ischemic event.\n\nThe Q wave is a negative deflection just prior to the R wave. Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI. They recommend testing such as cardiac MRI to assess for previous infarction in the appropriate patient population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating pathologic Q waves (red arrows). Note the deep and wide Q waves; this raises concern for a past ischemic event.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute myocardial infarctions would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG with possible reciprocal depressions. While T wave inversions may be indicative of new or acute ischemia, deep pathologic Q waves without ST elevation are indicative of previous infarction.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia would cause U waves on ECG, which appear as a small, \"second T wave\" after the initial T wave. Note they are not U-shaped despite their name. Management is centered on repletion of potassium and often magnesium as well.\n\nAnswer C: Intermittent torsades de pointes can cause syncope and should be suspected in a patient with syncope in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This patient\u2019s QT interval is not particularly prolonged, and his syncope seems to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Management is centered on cessation of QT-prolonging medications and magnesium administration. Note that while ondansetron does prolong the QT interval, it is unlikely to cause torsades given the patient took it a week ago.\n\nAnswer E: Pulmonary emboli would present on ECG with sinus tachycardia in addition to pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia. Note that the ECG is a nonspecific test for pulmonary emboli, and CT angiography is the preferred confirmatory test for this condition. Syncope is a possible presentation of larger pulmonary emboli (though the patient would also be hemodynamically unstable).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPathologic Q waves are indicative of a previous myocardial infarction.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation and the ECG findings, let's analyze the information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 67-year-old man who fainted after being outside in the heat. He returned to baseline quickly, which suggests a transient event rather than a prolonged medical issue. His vital signs show mild tachycardia (pulse of 107/min) but are otherwise stable.\n\n2. **Context of Fainting**: The fainting episode occurred after he stood up suddenly, which could indicate orthostatic hypotension or a vasovagal response, especially given the heat exposure and physical activity.\n\n3. **Use of Ondansetron**: The patient used a friend's prescription for ondansetron, which is an antiemetic. While ondansetron is generally safe, it can cause QT prolongation, which may lead to arrhythmias, particularly in the context of electrolyte imbalances.\n\n4. **ECG Analysis**: Although the ECG is not provided here, we can infer that the question is likely testing for a specific pattern associated with one of the options. Given the context of fainting, heat exposure, and the use of ondansetron, we should consider conditions that could lead to arrhythmias.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Acute myocardial infarction (A)**: This is less likely given the patient's quick recovery and lack of chest pain or other symptoms.\n   - **Hypokalemia (B)**: This could cause arrhythmias, but we need to see if the ECG shows signs of this (e.g., U waves, flattened T waves).\n   - **Intermittent torsades de pointes (C)**: This is characterized by a specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia often associated with prolonged QT interval, which can be caused by medications like ondansetron.\n   - **Previous myocardial ischemia (D)**: This would typically show changes on the ECG, but again, the acute nature of the event and the quick recovery make this less likely.\n   - **Pulmonary embolism (E)**: This could cause syncope but would typically present with more severe symptoms and possibly changes on the ECG (e.g., S1Q3T3 pattern).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's history of fainting after standing up, the use of ondansetron, and the likelihood of an ECG finding consistent with a prolonged QT interval leading to torsades de pointes, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**C) Intermittent torsades des pointes**.",

Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding. This stable patient with a benign exam can undergo a CT scan, which will offer more data than a FAST exam and would be performed regardless of whether a FAST exam was positive or negative given this patient's intoxication and abdominal bruising.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient who has experienced blunt abdominal trauma the most appropriate initial step in a stable patient is an abdominal CT scan.",

This suggests that the current treatment regimen is not effective for him.\n\n4. **Consideration of Options**:\n   - **(A) Continue current therapy for 1 more month**: Given that there has been no improvement after one month, it is not advisable to continue the same ineffective treatment.\n   - **(B) Dietary intervention**: While diet can play a role in acne, there is limited evidence to suggest that dietary changes alone would lead to significant improvement in a short time frame.\n   - **(C) Isotretinoin**: This is a powerful medication for severe acne but is typically reserved for cases that are resistant to other treatments or for severe forms of acne. The patient has not yet tried other options.\n   - **(D) Oral antibiotics**: These are often used for moderate to severe acne, especially when topical treatments fail. They can help reduce inflammation and bacterial load.\n   - **(E) Topical antibiotics**: These can be used, but they are generally less effective than oral antibiotics for moderate to severe cases.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the patient has not improved with topical treatments and considering the chronicity and potential severity of his acne, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate oral antibiotics.

This presentation is consistent with Dressler syndrome and the most appropriate initial step in management is aspirin.\n\nDressler syndrome is pericarditis that can occur after a myocardial infarction (MI). It most commonly occurs weeks to months after the MI, but can also occur within 1 week from an MI in rare cases. It is believed to result from an autoimmune reaction that occurs after damage to the heart (surgery and MI). It presents with chest pain, fever, pleuritic pain, and a pericardial friction rub. ECG demonstrates diffuse ST elevation with PR depression consistent with pericarditis. The most appropriate initial step in the management of this condition is symptomatic management with aspirin.\n\nLeib et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Dressler syndrome. They discuss how this condition is secondary pericarditis with or without pericardial effusion resulting from injury to the heart or pericardium. They recommend considering this syndrome in all patients with chest pain after a myocardial infarction.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an ECG with ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF (blue circles) suggesting a diagnosis of right-sided MI.\n\nFigure/Illustration B demonstrates an ECG with diffuse ST elevation and PR depression (blue circles) suggesting a diagnosis of pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 5: Angiography and stenting would be appropriate management if this patient were experiencing a repeat MI. The diffuse ST elevation and PR depression seen several days after his myocardial infarction are more indicative of pericarditis rather than a repeat MI. In addition, the chest pain the patient is experiencing can also occur in pericarditis and obfuscates the diagnosis of repeat MI.\n\nAnswers 3 & 4: Ibuprofen, other NSAIDs, and corticosteroids such as prednisone are not first-line therapy in post-MI pericarditis as they can hinder the healing and remodeling process of the myocardium. Current guidelines dictate that they may be used in cases that are refractory to initial therapy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDressler syndrome (post-MI pericarditis) presents with chest pain, pericardial friction rub, fever, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG, and should be treated initially with aspirin.",

These symptoms, especially the left arm pain, are suggestive of a possible cardiac event, such as angina or myocardial infarction.\n\n2. **Initial Management**: The patient is admitted to the step-down unit after appropriate management, which likely included medications for chest pain, possibly antiplatelet therapy, and monitoring.\n\n3. **Follow-Up Symptoms**: Two days later, the patient complains of chest pain again, which raises concern for ongoing cardiac issues, such as unstable angina or a myocardial infarction.\n\n4. **Repeat ECG**: The repeat ECG (not visible here) would provide critical information about the patient's cardiac status. If there are changes indicating ischemia or infarction, this would guide further management.\n\n5. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **(A) Angiography**: This is an invasive procedure used to visualize the coronary arteries and assess for blockages. It is often indicated in cases of suspected acute coronary syndrome, especially if there are significant ECG changes or ongoing symptoms.\n   - **(B) Aspirin**: This is an antiplatelet medication that is typically given in cases of suspected myocardial infarction or unstable angina to prevent clot formation.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral cataracts most likely has classic galactosemia. Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding. The author notes that there are safety concerns with regards to the high phyto-estrogenic isoflavone content of these formulas. The author recommends that despite these safety concerns, these formulas should still be used in patients with classic galactosemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods would be effective in the treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance. This disease presents similarly to classic galactosemia, but cataracts would not be seen in patients with this disease.\n\nAnswer C: Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement would be effective in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, associated findings in this disease would be anemia and avascular necrosis of the bones.\n\nAnswer D: Removing phenylalanine from the maternal diet during pregnancy would be effective in the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, these patients classically present with a \"musty smell\" and eczema.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 supplementation may be effective in mitigating the negative symptoms of homocystinuria. This disease may also present with cataracts or lens dislocations. Associated findings in this disorder would be marfanoid appearance and arachnodactyly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with classic galactosemia should not be breastfed and should receive a galactose-free and lactose-free diet such as soy-based formulas.",

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting. In general, syrup of ipecac is the wrong answer choice for all toxicity cases.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAcetaminophen toxicity should be treated immediately with N-acetyl cysteine followed by further diagnostic workup including serum acetaminophen levels.",

Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis.

This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis. She does not report symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (joint pain/stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with use).\n\nBullet Summary:\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis is treated with alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate).",

The patient states that his last drink was more than 1 year ago. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/78 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a non-tender, non-distended abdomen. Laboratory studies are notable for a serum calcium of 7.0 mg/dL. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is performed as seen in Figure A. A Sudan Black stain of the patient\u2019s stool is positive.

        "reason": "This patient with a history of alcoholism is presenting with steatorrhea (foul-smelling diarrhea that stains with Sudan Black, a stain that detects fat in the stool), hypocalcemia, and findings suggestive of chronic pancreatitis on CT scan (inflammatory changes and calcification). His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism. This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea. Treating the underlying cause in addition to rifaximin will eliminate the excess bacteria.\n\nBullet Summary:\nProton pump inhibitors should be given in patients with persistent diarrhea in the setting of chronic pancreatitis to prevent the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most appropriate treatment for the underlying cause of this patient's diarrhea, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step.\n\n1. **Patient History and Symptoms**: The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of alcoholism, presenting with abdominal pain and foul-smelling diarrhea for 2 years. The diarrhea is characterized as foul-smelling, which can suggest malabsorption or an infectious process.\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings**: The serum calcium level is notably low at 7.0 mg/dL, indicating hypocalcemia. This could be related to malabsorption, which is consistent with the foul-smelling diarrhea.\n\n3. **Stool Examination**: The positive Sudan Black stain indicates the presence of fat in the stool, which is characteristic of steatorrhea. This suggests that the patient is experiencing fat malabsorption, likely due to pancreatic insufficiency.\n\n4. **Underlying Cause**: Given the patient's history of alcoholism, it is plausible that he has developed chronic pancreatitis, which can lead to pancreatic insufficiency and resultant malabsorption of fats, leading to steatorrhea.\n\n5. **Treatment Options**:\n   - (A) Ciprofloxacin: An antibiotic, not indicated for fat malabsorption.\n   - (B) Loperamide: An anti-diarrheal, not addressing the underlying cause.\n   - (C) Oral rehydration: Useful for dehydration but does not treat the underlying issue.\n   - (D) Pantoprazole: A proton pump inhibitor, not relevant to fat malabsorption.\n   - (E) Rifaximin: An antibiotic that can be used for certain types of diarrhea, but not specifically for fat malabsorption.\n\n6. **Most Appropriate Treatment**: The underlying cause of the diarrhea is likely due to pancreatic insufficiency from chronic pancreatitis, which is common in patients with a history of alcoholism. The appropriate treatment for this condition is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which is not listed among the options.

This could indicate increased intracranial pressure or other serious neurological conditions.\n\n5. **Physical Exam Findings**: The presence of mild bibasilar crackles could suggest some pulmonary involvement, but the primary concern here is the neurological symptoms and the sudden headache.\n\n6. **Initial Management Considerations**: Given the acute onset of a severe headache, confusion, and double vision, the most pressing concern is to rule out any life-threatening conditions such as a hemorrhagic stroke or other intracranial pathology.\n\n7. **Diagnostic Imaging**: In cases of sudden severe headache, especially with neurological deficits, a CT scan of the head is typically the first step in management to quickly assess for any acute intracranial issues, such as bleeding or mass effect.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options provided:\n\n(A) Amoxicillin-clavulinic acid - This is an antibiotic and not appropriate for the acute neurological symptoms presented.\n\n(B) CT of the head - This is the most appropriate initial step to rule out serious conditions like hemorrhage.\n\n(C) Dexamethasone - This is a steroid that may be used in cases of increased intracranial pressure or certain types of brain tumors, but it is not the first step in this acute scenario.\n\n(D) MRI of the head - While MRI is useful for detailed imaging, it is not the first-line imaging in acute settings due to longer acquisition times compared to CT.\n\n(E) Piperacillin-tazobactam - This is another antibiotic and not relevant to the acute headache and neurological symptoms.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate initial step in management is:\n\n**B) CT of the head**",

Of the answer choices given, angiodysplasia is the most likely to cause such profuse and sudden bleeding.\n\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly in the colon. The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. The authors note that angiodysplasias are the cause of many \"occult\" GI bleeds not visualized on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. The authors recommend the use of capsule endoscopy in occult GI bleeds to identify angiodysplasias as a potential source.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Erosion into a gastric vessel is the pathophysiology of a bleeding gastric vessel secondary to peptic ulcer disease. This usually presents with melena (black tarry stools) rather than bright red blood per rectum. Only in cases of extremely brisk upper GI bleeding would patients present with bright red blood per rectum. Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Diverticulosis presents with bright red blood and is possible in this patient, but it does not involve inflammation or infection, which defines diverticulitis.\n\nAnswer C: Malignancy or colon cancer can present with bright red blood per rectum, malaise, weight loss, and microcytic anemia. While it is possible in this patient, his age, lack of risk factors for colon cancer, and the sudden onset of his symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.\n\nAnswer D: Submucosal esophageal (Mallory-Weiss) tear presents after profuse vomiting (as in this patient) with bloody vomitus. Treatment is supportive and involves antiemetics.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation that presents with bright red blood per rectum.",

He has a history of heavy drinking and vomiting profusely the night before. He is otherwise healthy and currently feels well.\n\n2. **Symptoms**: The bright red blood in the stool suggests a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, as bright red blood typically indicates that the source of bleeding is closer to the rectum. The fact that he vomited profusely could indicate some form of upper GI irritation or injury.\n\n3. **Physical Exam and Vital Signs**: The physical exam shows a nontender abdomen and normal bowel sounds, which suggests that there is no acute abdomen or significant obstruction. His vital signs are stable, indicating he is not in shock.\n\n4. **Laboratory Studies**: The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are within normal limits, which suggests that he is not currently experiencing significant blood loss. The leukocyte count and platelet count are also normal.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **(A) Erosion into a gastric vessel**: This could cause upper GI bleeding, but the blood would likely be darker (melena) rather than bright red.\n   - **(B) Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching (diverticulitis)**: This typically presents with abdominal pain and possibly fever, which this patient does not have.\n   - **(C) Malignancy**: While malignancy can cause rectal bleeding, the acute nature of the symptoms and the patient's age make this less likely.\n   - **(D) Submucosal esophageal tear (Mallory-Weiss tear)**: This is a tear in the esophagus due to severe vomiting, which can lead to hematemesis (vomiting blood) but not typically bright red blood in the stool.\n   - **(E) Vascular malformation**: This could cause lower GI bleeding, but it is less common and usually presents with chronic bleeding rather than acute.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's history of heavy drinking and vomiting, the most likely cause of his symptoms is a **submucosal esophageal tear (Mallory-Weiss tear)**, which can occur due to the forceful vomiting and can lead to bleeding that may be seen in the stool if there is a significant amount of blood loss.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:\n\n**(D) Submucosal esophageal tear**.",

Empiric IV antibiotic therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam is the most appropriate initial management.\n\nPasteurella multocida is a gram-negative rod that is associated with cat and dog bites. Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen. Antibiotics can then be narrowed down accordingly. Patients will often require between 4-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment. MRSA coverage may initially be started and tapered later once cultures result.\n\nMollitt reviews the evidence regarding the microbiology of various injuries. He discusses how Pasteurella multocida is a common complication of animal bites. He recommends early effective antibiotic treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answer:\nAnswer A: Amoxicillin and clavulanate can be used to treat Pasteurella infection. Patients with osteomyelitis should not be treated with oral antibiotics initially, in particular, when there are systemic manifestations as is present in this patient. IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam are the mainstay for empiric osteomyelitis treatment after an animal bite in a patient with systemic manifestations.\n\nAnswer C: Doxycycline is used to treat uncomplicated chlamydia infections. Gonococcal osteomyelitis may present in sexually active individuals and may be associated with septic arthritis. Sexually active patients may be suspected of having this disease.\n\nAnswer D: Fluconazole is an antifungal that is used to treat Candida osteomyelitis. Candida osteomyelitis would be highly unusual in patients with no other risk factors. Instead, this disease is more common in immunodeficient patients or those who use IV drugs.\n\nAnswer E: Vancomycin is used for MRSA infections. Although S. aureus is the most common overall cause of osteomyelitis, this patient with a recent animal bite most likely has Pasteurella infection and this organism should be covered accordingly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with suspicion of Pasteurella osteomyelitis infection after an animal bite should be treated with empiric IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam.",

Cat bites can introduce bacteria such as *Pasteurella multocida*, which is commonly associated with cat bites and can lead to osteomyelitis.\n\n2. **Symptoms and Findings**: The child has fever, pain in the leg, and an open wound with erythema and edema. The MRI findings consistent with osteomyelitis further support the diagnosis of a serious infection.\n\n3. **Antibiotic Coverage**: The choice of antibiotics should cover the likely pathogens associated with cat bites. *Pasteurella multocida* is typically sensitive to penicillins, and thus, a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate (Augmentin) is often recommended for such infections.\n\n4. **Other Options**: \n   - Ampicillin and sulbactam (B) is also a good choice for broader coverage but is typically used in more severe cases or when hospitalization is required.\n   - Doxycycline (C) is not appropriate for this age group and does not cover *Pasteurella* effectively.\n   - Fluconazole (D) is an antifungal and not indicated here.\n   - Vancomycin (E) is used for MRSA coverage but is not the first line for cat bite infections.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management for this child with osteomyelitis following a cat bite is:\n\n**(A) Amoxicillin and clavulanate**.",

The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications. They recommend assessing BNP levels in patients who are suspected of having CHF.\n\nFigure A is a chart with changes in brain natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, sodium, and potassium that would be seen in various diseases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, and high potassium does not reflect the changes that would be seen in CHF. Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF. This pattern would be seen in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH where excessive resorption of free water results in hemodilution.\n\nAnswer E: Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and normal potassium reflect the findings in a healthy patient. This patient most likely has CHF, which would result in increased aldosterone and ADH function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCommon lab findings in heart failure include elevated BNP, elevated ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",

His oxygen saturation is acceptable at 96%.\n\n2. **Physical Exam Findings**:\n   - **Fatigue**: This could indicate a chronic condition.\n   - **Cardiovascular Exam**: The presence of an additional heart sound after S2 suggests possible heart failure or volume overload.\n   - **Pulmonary Exam**: Bilateral crackles indicate fluid in the lungs, which is often seen in heart failure or pulmonary edema.\n   - **Abdominal Exam**: An obese abdomen without pain could suggest obesity-related issues or ascites.\n   - **Lower Extremity Edema**: Bilateral pitting edema is a classic sign of fluid retention, often associated with heart failure.\n\n3. **Clinical Interpretation**: The combination of shortness of breath, crackles in the lungs, additional heart sounds, and bilateral pitting edema strongly suggests congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's obesity may also contribute to his symptoms.\n\n4. **Laboratory Values**: In cases of heart failure, we would expect to see elevated levels of certain biomarkers:\n   - **B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)**: This is often elevated in heart failure due to increased cardiac wall stress.\n   - **Electrolytes**: Depending on the severity of heart failure, we might see changes in sodium and potassium levels.\n   - **Renal Function Tests**: These may show elevated creatinine if there is renal impairment due to heart failure.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without the specific lab values shown in Figure A, we can deduce that the most likely lab values for this patient would include elevated BNP levels, possible electrolyte imbalances, and possibly elevated creatinine. \n\nNow, based on the options provided (A, B, C, D, E), we would select the option that reflects elevated BNP and possibly other changes consistent with heart failure.\n\nSince I do not have access to Figure A, I cannot definitively choose an option.

Patients with homocystinuria are also at an increased risk of thromboembolic events that disproportionally affect the cerebral vessels. Similar to Marfan syndrome, patients have phenotypic features of a Marfanoid habitus, including tall stature, long limbs, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, pectus deformity, and scoliosis. Treatment includes vitamin B6 supplementation.\n\nHasan et al. review the evidence regarding diseases associated with homocystinuria. They discuss how this disease is associated with cancer and Alzheimer disease. They recommend screening for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aortic dissection is a complication of Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene. It is also associated with elevated homocysteine levels. Although Marfan syndrome shares many features with homocystinuria, the fair complexion, and intellectual disability seen in this patient are specific to homocystinuria. Treatment involves avoidance of contact sports and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer B: Medullary thyroid cancer is part of the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B), which is caused by a mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. Patients with MEN2B present with Marfanoid habitus, but they do not present with the other features described in this vignette, including fair complexion, intellectual disability, and downward lens subluxation. Treatment is with surgical excision of tumors.\n\nAnswer C: Osteoarthritis is a complication of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Although patients with EDS may present with many of the phenotypic features of both Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria, patients are much less likely to have lens subluxation. Osteoarthritis may be seen with higher incidence in patients with homocystinuria. Treatment is with brace support of unstable joints.\n\nAnswer E: Wilms tumor is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a pediatric overgrowth disorder usually caused by a mutation at chromosome 11p15. BWS presents with macrosomia (\u201cgigantism\u201d), which is defined as height and weight > 97th percentile. BWS additionally presents with omphalocele, hemihyperplasia, visceromegaly, neonatal hypoglycemia, and other embryonal tumors, including hepatoblastoma and neuroblastoma.

Physical exam reveals an obtunded man covered in vomit, with track marks on his arm and several skin abscesses. The patient is given 4 liters of Ringer lactate and intravenous antibiotics. As the fourth liter of fluids is finishing, the patient is noted to have jugular venous distension and an oxygen saturation of 92% on nonrebreather. He is subsequently intubated.

        "reason": "This patient who uses intravenous drugs with skin abscesses (the likely source of his infection) is hypotensive and tachycardic, with a blood pressure that is not responding to IV fluids; this is concerning for septic shock. Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor). Finally, the fourth line vasopressor for septic shock is phenylephrine.\n\nLevy et al. review sepsis. They update the Surviving Sepsis campaign which gives the most up to date management guidelines of sepsis including adequate fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors. They recommend early antibiotics and resuscitation to minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia. Note the presence of P waves (red arrows highlighting several examples) that are present throughout all leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardioversion would be appropriate in an unstable patient with unstable vital signs in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation would present with an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Cardioversion would not be indicated in sinus tachycardia.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone is a potent glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid properties. While giving an IV steroid may have a permissive effect on blood pressure (via upregulating alpha-1 receptors on the vasculature) there is no reason that this patient would have a low cortisol level (such as in chronic steroid use). Epinephrine is a better answer in this case, though steroids can be considered. Steroids are typically reserved for patients failing at least 2 vasopressors (unless they have a known cortisol-deficient state).\n\nAnswer D: Normal saline is unlikely to benefit this patient as he has already been sufficiently fluid resuscitated. Moreover, it seems the patient may be developing pulmonary edema (hypoxia, jugular venous distension), a sign of fluid overload.\n\nAnswer E: Phenylephrine is the fourth line vasopressor and is an alpha-1 agonist. It is much less potent than norepinephrine and epinephrine, and would not be started in the management of septic shock until the patient has received epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn septic shock, the vasopressors given (in order) are norepinephrine, epinephrine/vasopressin, then phenylephrine.",

He has a history of intravenous drug use, which raises suspicion for possible substance overdose or infection.\n\n2. **Physical Exam Findings**: The patient is obtunded, covered in vomit, has track marks, and skin abscesses, indicating possible intravenous drug use complications, such as infection or overdose.\n\n3. **Initial Management**: The patient received 4 liters of Ringer's lactate and intravenous antibiotics, which suggests he is being treated for septic shock or volume depletion.\n\n4. **Current Condition**: After the fluid resuscitation, the patient develops jugular venous distension (JVD) and has an oxygen saturation of 92% on a non-rebreather mask. JVD can indicate fluid overload or right heart failure, especially in the context of hypotension and altered mental status.\n\n5. **Intubation and Monitoring**: The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress, and an ECG was obtained. The blood pressure remains low at 85/44 mmHg despite the administration of norepinephrine, which is a vasopressor used to treat hypotension.\n\n6. **Next Steps in Management**: Given the patient's persistent hypotension despite norepinephrine, we need to consider the most appropriate next step. The options provided are:\n   - (A) Cardioversion: Typically used for arrhythmias, not indicated here without evidence of a specific arrhythmia.\n   - (B) Epinephrine: Another vasopressor, but norepinephrine is usually preferred for septic shock.\n   - (C) Hydrocortisone: Can be used in cases of adrenal insufficiency or severe septic shock, but not the immediate next step.\n   - (D) Normal saline: Additional fluid may worsen JVD and fluid overload.\n   - (E) Phenylephrine: A pure alpha-agonist that can increase blood pressure but does not have the same inotropic effects as norepinephrine.\n\nGiven the context of the patient being in shock with signs of possible fluid overload (JVD), the most appropriate next step would be to consider a medication that can help increase blood pressure without causing further fluid overload. \n\n**Conclusion**: The best option here is (E) Phenylephrine, as it can help increase systemic vascular resistance and improve blood pressure without adding more fluid volume. \n\nThus, the answer is **E**.",

The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma. They found that various molecular groups have been identified allowing for subtyping of these lesions. They recommend performing a CT scan to better characterize these lesions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT with an enhancing mass with a hypoattenuating fatty component. This is characteristically seen in large hepatic adenomas, which are solitary well-marginated lesions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole would be an effective treatment if this patient had contracted Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food or water on his recent trip to Mexico. While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma. If an adenoma is on the differential, biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of rupture and hemorrhage intraoperatively.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHepatic adenomas are benign, vascular liver masses associated with oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids that should be promptly resected if large and symptomatic.",

Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure. Further care involves blood pressure control and benzodiazepines as needed to abort seizure episodes (though note that if a patient with preeclampsia is having seizures, by definition, they have eclampsia).\n\nAl-Safi et al. discuss preeclampsia and eclampsia.

The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin).

        "raw_response": "To determine the appropriate antibiotic to administer first in this clinical scenario, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 57-year-old man with confusion, hypotension (blood pressure 64/33 mmHg), tachycardia (pulse 160/min), and respiratory distress (respirations 32/min). He has a dark, purpuric rash on his torso and extremities, which is concerning for a serious infection, possibly sepsis.\n\n2. **Recent History**: The patient was recently seen for profuse epistaxis and is on warfarin for atrial fibrillation. The recent bleeding episode and current presentation suggest a potential underlying infection that could be exacerbated by his anticoagulation therapy.\n\n3. **Signs of Infection**: The obtunded state, hypotension, tachycardia, and purpuric rash raise suspicion for a severe systemic infection, possibly septic shock. The purpuric rash could indicate meningococcemia or another type of severe bacterial infection.\n\n4. **Antibiotic Selection**: In cases of suspected sepsis, especially with purpura, broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically initiated promptly. The options provided include:\n   - (A) Clindamycin: Good for anaerobes and some gram-positive bacteria, but not broad enough for initial sepsis treatment.\n   - (B) Meropenem: A broad-spectrum carbapenem effective against a wide range of bacteria, including resistant strains.\n   - (C) Penicillin: Limited coverage, not broad enough for initial sepsis treatment.\n   - (D) Piperacillin-tazobactam: Broad-spectrum coverage, including Pseudomonas and anaerobes.\n   - (E) Vancomycin: Essential for coverage against MRSA and other resistant gram-positive bacteria.\n\n5. **First-Line Treatment**: In cases of suspected septic shock, especially with a purpuric rash, it is critical to cover for both gram-negative and resistant gram-positive organisms. Therefore, a combination of vancomycin (for MRSA) and a broad-spectrum agent like piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem would be appropriate.\n\nGiven the urgency of the situation and the need for immediate broad-spectrum coverage, the first antibiotic to administer should be **Vancomycin (E)**, as it covers resistant gram-positive bacteria, which is crucial in the setting of severe sepsis with purpura.\n\nThus, the answer is **E**.",

This is an ominous finding and suggests a diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) though it may also be seen in other infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis or after ischemic events. ARVD is an autosomal dominant condition where there is fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall predisposing the patient (classically younger patients) to sudden cardiac death from lethal ventricular dysrhythmias. The epsilon wave is the most specific finding; however, other findings include T wave inversion in V1-V3 or a left bundle branch appearance with frequent premature ventricular complexes among other possibilities. This is a potentially lethal diagnosis and requires management with antiarrhythmics (such as beta-blockers or amiodarone) and the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\nKayser et al. review AVRD.

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium.

They can be removed surgically if the patient desires.\n\nNazer et al. study the risk factors associated with the development of cherry angioma. They found that the use of clopidogrel and tamsulosin is associated with these lesions. They recommend ruling out underlying conditions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates cherry red macules/papules classically seen in patients with cherry angioma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Edema of the epidermis describes eczema or atopic dermatitis. This disease would present with pruritic, erythematous, and vesicular lesions. Topical creams and hygiene can be used for symptomatic management of these lesions.\n\nAnswer C: Healthy dermatologic development misses the diagnosis of a cherry angioma, which although benign, is a more accurate diagnosis for this case.\n\nAnswer D: Malignant blood vessel proliferation does not describe a cherry angioma which is benign and purely cosmetic. An angiosarcoma usually occurs in deep tissues and requires surgical excision.\n\nAnswer E: Viral infection describes herpes simplex virus which would present with vesicular lesions and neurogenic pain. These patients can be treated with valacyclovir as well as gabapentin for neuropathic pain.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCherry angiomas are benign capillary proliferations that appear as cherry red macules/papules.",

This suggests a dermatological issue that may be persistent or worsening.\n\n2. **Recent Exposure**: The patient was recently exposed to his grandfather, who has vesicular lesions on his skin. Vesicular lesions are often associated with viral infections, particularly those caused by herpes viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus).\n\n3. **Family History**: The family history of skin cancer, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer is relevant but does not directly indicate the nature of the rash.\n\n4. **Medical History**: The patient has asthma and seasonal allergies, which may indicate a predisposition to allergic reactions or skin conditions, but again, this does not directly point to a specific diagnosis.\n\n5. **Physical Exam**: The physical exam findings are crucial, but since we do not have access to Figure A, we must rely on the context provided. Given the exposure to a person with vesicular lesions, it is reasonable to suspect a viral etiology.\n\n6. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) Benign capillary proliferation: This typically refers to conditions like cherry angiomas, which do not fit the context of a rash related to viral exposure.\n   - (B) Edema of the epidermis: This could describe conditions like contact dermatitis or allergic reactions, but again, the context of viral exposure makes this less likely.\n   - (C) Healthy dermatologic development: This option does not apply as the patient is concerned about a rash.\n   - (D) Malignant blood vessel proliferation: This would refer to conditions like angiosarcoma, which is unlikely given the context.\n   - (E) Viral infection: Given the exposure to a person with vesicular lesions and the nature of the rash, this is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:\n\n**E) Viral infection**",

He states that he has been working in a hot, humid attic all day and forgot his water bottle. He felt dizzy when standing up and then fainted and was unconscious for roughly 1 minute. He awoke at his neurologic baseline afterwards. The patient has a history of hypertension being managed by his primary care doctor. His temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 149/82 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a diaphoretic man. He demonstrates an unremarkable cardiopulmonary exam. The patient walks with a steady gait and his neurologic exam is non-focal. An ECG is performed as seen in Figure A. The patient is given 2 liters of oral fluids and feels back to his baseline.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with dizziness and syncope in the setting of likely dehydration (working in a hot/humid environment without water) and feels better after rehydration, suggesting a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block. Note the left axis deviation as suggested by the net upward deflection of the QRS in lead I and net downward deflection in lead II (blue arrows). Then, note the appearance of a right bundle branch block with the RSR pattern in aVR (black arrow) and upward R\u2019 in lead V1 (green arrow). This is a classic pattern for bifascicular block. Contrast this to the other pattern of bifascicular block which would present with a right bundle branch block and right axis deviation (upward QRS in lead II and downward in lead I), which was not seen in this case.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atrial fibrillation may occur secondary to aging, hypertension, or ischemia and presents with an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with an absence of P waves. It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection. It presents on ECG with QRS complexes that twist in amplitude around the electrical baseline. Treatment involves the administration of magnesium sulfate and, if needed, electrical cardioversion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA bifascicular block can progress to complete heart block.",

He is diaphoretic but has an unremarkable cardiopulmonary exam and a non-focal neurologic exam.\n\n3. **ECG**: The question mentions an ECG was performed, but we do not have the visual of Figure A. However, we can infer that the ECG may show signs related to his current state of dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalances due to heat exposure and lack of fluid intake.\n\n4. **Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance**: Given the patient's history of working in a hot attic and not drinking water, he is likely experiencing dehydration. Dehydration can lead to various complications, including electrolyte imbalances, which can affect heart rhythm.\n\n5. **Potential Complications**: \n   - **Atrial fibrillation (A)**: This is a common arrhythmia but is less likely to be directly related to dehydration in an otherwise healthy individual.\n   - **Complete heart block (B)**: This is a serious condition but typically does not arise from dehydration alone.\n   - **Myocardial infarction (C)**: While stress and dehydration can contribute to heart issues, the patient does not show classic signs of a heart attack.\n   - **Stroke (D)**: The patient is neurologically intact upon waking, making this less likely.\n   - **Torsades des pointes (E)**: This is a specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can occur due to electrolyte imbalances, particularly low magnesium or potassium levels, which can be exacerbated by dehydration.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the context of dehydration and the potential for electrolyte imbalances, the most likely condition to occur in this patient based on his current history and the implications of his situation is **Torsades des pointes (E)**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **E**.",

Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma. They discuss how patients often sustain these injuries from extreme sports. They recommend being aware of this syndrome so that acute interventions can be taken.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a biconvex hyperdensity that is limited by suture lines (red circle). This is the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma on head CT.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins results in a subdural hematoma (SDH). An acute SDH more commonly presents with a gradual increase in headache and confusion rather than the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome presented in this vignette. However, a minority of patients with acute SDH may have a lucid interval followed by progressive neurological decline. SDH would have a crescent-shaped appearance on head CT rather than the biconvex appearance of an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries describes a lacunar stroke. Although this patient has 2 risk factors for lacunar stroke (hypertension and smoking), this patient\u2019s head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer D: A ruptured cerebral aneurysm would most likely lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap headache\u201d), confusion or somnolence, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Surgical clipping or embolization of the bleeding vessel may be required.\n\nAnswer E: Secondary hemorrhage into a prior area of infarction usually occurs in the setting of a recent embolic stroke. Although this patient has a history of TIA and other risk factors for stroke, his head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.

This type of trauma can lead to various types of brain injuries, including concussions, contusions, and more severe injuries like subdural or epidural hematomas.\n\n2. **Initial Presentation**: The patient initially had a GCS of 15, indicating he was fully conscious and oriented. However, he lost consciousness for about 30 seconds and then became mildly confused. This suggests a transient alteration in consciousness, which is common in mild traumatic brain injury.\n\n3. **Progression of Symptoms**: After being evaluated, the patient became gradually more somnolent, leading to a GCS of 7. This significant decline in consciousness is concerning for a more serious intracranial injury, such as a hematoma.\n\n4. **Medical History**: The patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and a prior transient ischemic attack (TIA). These factors can increase the risk of vascular issues in the brain.\n\n5. **Head CT**: Although we do not have access to Figure A, the context suggests that the CT likely shows some form of bleeding or hematoma, which is common after head trauma.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) **Damage to the cerebral bridging veins**: This is associated with subdural hematomas, which can occur after acceleration-deceleration injuries. Given the mechanism of injury and the patient's decline in GCS, this is a strong possibility.\n\n(B) **Damage to the sphenoid bone**: While this could lead to complications, it is less directly related to the acute change in consciousness observed in this patient.\n\n(C) **Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries**: This is more related to chronic conditions and would not typically present acutely after trauma.\n\n(D) **Ruptured cerebral aneurysm**: This would usually present with sudden severe headache and neurological deficits, not typically after a skiing accident without prior symptoms.\n\n(E) **Secondary hemorrhage into prior area of infarction**: This is less likely given the acute nature of the injury and the fact that the patient was previously functioning well.\n\nConsidering the mechanism of injury, the initial GCS, the subsequent decline, and the common types of injuries associated with such trauma, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is:\n\n**(A) Damage to the cerebral bridging veins** (leading to a subdural hematoma). \n\nThus, the answer is **A**.",

A digital rectal exam may temporarily relieve the obstruction and lead to the expulsion of gas and stool (the \u201csquirt sign\u201d). Abdominal radiography typically demonstrates signs of distal intestinal obstruction such as proximal dilation and an absence of air in the rectum.

This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Duodenal atresia is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and may also present in the first 48 hours of life with bilious vomiting. The abdominal radiograph will demonstrate the \u201cdouble bubble\u201d sign, which reflects air trapping in the stomach and first portion of the duodenum. Treatment is with the surgical opening of the atretic segment.\n\nAnswer C: Intestinal malrotation may preset with bilious vomiting in a neonate due to the development of a midgut volvulus. An abdominal radiograph may show the extension of the nasogastric tube into an abnormally positioned duodenum and would not show diffuse colonic distension. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the volvulus.\n\nAnswer D: Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and also presents with delayed (> 48 hours) passing of meconium. The distal obstruction in these patients will not be temporarily relieved by a digital rectal exam. Contrast enema will demonstrate microcolon involving the entire large bowel.

Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.",

The swelling is diffuse, and there is no change in head circumference over the next 12 hours, which suggests that the swelling is not due to an accumulation of fluid that would typically increase head circumference.\n\n3. **Understanding the Types of Scalp Swelling**:\n   - **Caput succedaneum**: This is a type of swelling that occurs due to the pressure of the presenting part of the fetus against the cervix during labor. It crosses suture lines and is usually present at birth.\n   - **Cephalohematoma**: This occurs when there is bleeding between the skull and the periosteum, typically due to trauma during delivery. It does not cross suture lines and can take time to develop after birth.\n   - **Subgaleal hemorrhage**: This is bleeding in the space between the periosteum and the galea aponeurosis, which can occur with vacuum-assisted deliveries and can lead to significant swelling.\n\n4. **Analysis of the Options**:\n   - (A) Between dura and arachnoid mater: This refers to a subdural hematoma, which is not indicated here.\n   - (B) Between periosteum and galea aponeurosis: This is where a subgaleal hemorrhage occurs, which fits the description of diffuse swelling and the mechanism of vacuum-assisted delivery.\n   - (C) Between periosteum and skull: This refers to a cephalohematoma, which typically does not present as diffuse swelling and does not cross suture lines.\n   - (D) Between scalp and galea aponeurosis: This is not a recognized space for significant bleeding or swelling.\n   - (E) Into the lateral ventricles: This is not relevant to the described condition.\n\nGiven the details of the case, the most likely space affected by the diffuse swelling in this newborn, especially considering the vacuum-assisted delivery, is:\n\n**Answer: (B) Between periosteum and galea aponeurosis**.",

        "answer_idx": "B",
        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a preceding viral illness, dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop from 150/85 to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration), an echocardiogram with impaired diastolic filling, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG. This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.",

He has been less mobile due to recent surgery (Achilles tendon repair) and has had a recent cold.\n\n2. **Symptoms**: He presents with worsening dyspnea over the past 48 hours, which is provoked by walking short distances. This suggests a possible cardiac or pulmonary issue.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**: His vital signs show a slight fever (99.2\u00b0F), elevated blood pressure (150/85 mmHg), normal pulse (82/min), and normal respiratory rate (16/min). Importantly, his oxygen saturation is 100% on room air, indicating that he is not hypoxemic.\n\n4. **Physical Exam Findings**: Notable findings include jugular venous distension (JVD), which can indicate right heart failure or fluid overload. The blood pressure during inspiration is 130/70 mmHg, which suggests a possible pulsus paradoxus, often seen in conditions like cardiac tamponade.\n\n5. **Echocardiogram Results**: The echocardiogram shows impaired diastolic filling with normal ventricular contractility. This is a key finding, as it suggests that the heart is having difficulty filling properly during diastole, which can occur in conditions like restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, or cardiac tamponade.\n\n6. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Cardiac Tamponade (A)**: Typically presents with JVD, hypotension, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad). The echocardiogram findings could fit, but the patient does not show hypotension.\n   - **Constrictive Pericarditis (B)**: Can cause JVD and impaired diastolic filling. The history of recent surgery and less mobility could contribute to this condition.\n   - **Myocardial Infarction (C)**: Would typically present with chest pain and possibly ST changes on ECG, which are not mentioned here.\n   - **Pulmonary Embolism (D)**: Would likely present with acute dyspnea and possibly hypoxemia, but the oxygen saturation is normal.\n   - **Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (E)**: Can also cause impaired diastolic filling and JVD, but the history does not strongly support this over constrictive pericarditis.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given the combination of JVD, impaired diastolic filling, and the recent history of decreased mobility (which could lead to fluid accumulation), the most likely diagnosis is **constrictive pericarditis**. This condition can develop after surgery or due to other inflammatory processes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**B) Constrictive pericarditis**.",

        "reason": "This patient with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is presenting with respiratory distress (increased work of breathing, hypoxia, wheezes, and crackles) in the setting of atrial fibrillation (ECG with irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves) with rapid ventricular response and pulmonary edema on chest radiograph. Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.",

The most appropriate initial treatment is symptomatic relief with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nReduced estrogen levels after menopause lead to vulvovaginal atrophy by causing reduced blood flow and collagen content in vulvovaginal tissues. Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues. Finally, hormone replacement therapy is indicated if symptoms are refractory to all other modalities.\n\nBhupathiraju et al. studied the association between vaginal estrogen and chronic disease risk. The authors found no association between low-dose vaginal estrogen and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and hip fractures over an 18-year period.

While patients with trichomoniasis can present with cervical petechiae and punctate hemorrhages, they typically also have frothy green discharge (absent in this patient). While patients with bacterial vaginosis can also have vaginal discharge, the discharge is typically malodorous and symptoms of pruritis are generally absent.\n\nAnswer B: Nitrofurantoin is the treatment of choice for urinary tract infections. While this patient has increased urinary frequency and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, her normal urinalysis makes the diagnosis of urinary tract infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer C: Topical clobetasol cream is the treatment for lichen sclerosis. While lichen sclerosis can present with pain with intercourse and vulvar pruritis, patients often have plaques that disrupt the normal vulvar architecture. Lichen sclerosis does not affect the vaginal tissues.\n\nAnswer D: Topical estrogen is the treatment of choice for cases of vulvovaginal atrophy resistant to treatment with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.

        "reason": "This patient's progressively increasing PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex on ECG is consistent with second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz type I, also referred to as Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nSecond degree AV block, Mobitz type I can occur in a variety of settings, such as in the context of digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or increased vagal tone. On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension. The treatment is pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSecond degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I, is characterized by progressively lengthening PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex.",

This is significant and suggests a potential conduction issue or a physiological response.\n\n3. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Although we do not have the visual of Figure A, we can infer that the ECG likely shows some form of heart block or bradycardia based on the context of the question and the patient's symptoms.\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **(A) First degree atrioventricular block**: This is characterized by a prolonged PR interval but typically does not cause bradycardia.\n   - **(B) Second degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I (Wenckebach)**: This is characterized by progressive lengthening of the PR interval until a beat is dropped. It can be associated with bradycardia but is usually not as severe.\n   - **(C) Second degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type II**: This is characterized by a consistent PR interval with sudden dropped beats. It can lead to more significant bradycardia and is more concerning than type I.\n   - **(D) Sinus bradycardia**: This is a condition where the heart rate is less than 60 bpm but the rhythm is regular and originates from the sinus node. It can be normal in well-conditioned athletes or due to increased vagal tone.\n   - **(E) Third degree atrioventricular block**: This is a complete block where there is no conduction between the atria and ventricles, leading to a very slow heart rate and is a medical emergency.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's bradycardia (pulse of 55/min) and the context of her symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is **(D) Sinus bradycardia**. This is a common finding in young, healthy individuals, especially those who are physically fit, and can be exacerbated by factors such as increased vagal tone or medications (though she is not on any). \n\nThus, the answer is **D**.",

        "reason": "This patient\u2019s new-onset palpitations, irregularly irregular pulse, and absent p-waves on ECG are consistent with atrial fibrillation. In hemodynamically stable patients with a relative contraindication to \u03b2-blockers (COPD on home oxygen with increasing oxygen need), rate control with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil is preferred.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. ECG findings will be an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves with an erratic baseline as shown in Illustration A. Treatment is centered on rate control. First-line agents for rate control include \u03b21 selective blockers (metoprolol and esmolol) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem). In patients with COPD, non-selective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, timolol, and sotalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction by activating \u03b22-adrenoreceptors. Other relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers include Raynaud disease and depression (increased risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction). In patients with relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred initial treatment option.\n\nVan Gelder et al. studied lenient (resting heart rate < 110 beats per minute) versus strict rate control (resting heart rate < 80 beats per minute) in patients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized control trial. The authors found that there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmias between the 2 groups. The authors recommend a lenient rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG lacking P waves (red arrows) and irregularly irregular RR intervals (red/blue lines), which are classic findings in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic that can be used in patients to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is often suitable to use in patients with depressed left ventricular function. Amiodarone has multiple multi-system adverse effects including pulmonary toxicity, and it is not used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer B: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Although patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, the preferred anticoagulation agents are warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban).\n\nAnswer C: Digoxin can be used as a rate control agent in atrial fibrillation as it directly suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of toxicity, it is used as second-line therapy when first-line agents fail.\n\nAnswer D: Metoprolol is a \u03b2-blocker that is a first-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice. This patient has COPD with increasing oxygen needs making calcium channel blockers possibly a better choice.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation and relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice.",

He is currently on medications for these conditions and has a significant smoking and alcohol history.\n\n2. **Vital Signs and Symptoms**: His vital signs show a pulse of 125/min, indicating tachycardia. He has an irregular pulse, which raises suspicion for atrial fibrillation (AF) or another type of arrhythmia. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or loss of consciousness, which is somewhat reassuring.\n\n3. **Echocardiogram Findings**: The echocardiogram from a month ago showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60-65%, which is within normal limits, suggesting that there is no significant heart failure at this time.\n\n4. **Current Oxygen Requirement**: The patient requires 3 liters of oxygen today, indicating some respiratory compromise, likely due to his COPD.\n\n5. **ECG Interpretation**: Although the ECG image is not provided here, the context suggests that the patient may have atrial fibrillation, especially given the irregular pulse and the history of palpitations.\n\n6. **Treatment Options**:\n   - **Amiodarone (A)**: This is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used for various types of tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, but it is not the first-line treatment for rate control.\n   - **Clopidogrel (B)**: This is an antiplatelet medication, not used for tachycardia.\n   - **Digoxin (C)**: This can be used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, especially in patients with heart failure, but it is less effective in patients with normal heart function and may not be the best first choice.\n   - **Metoprolol (D)**: This is a beta-blocker that is commonly used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and is generally well-tolerated, especially in patients with a history of hypertension.\n   - **Verapamil (E)**: This is a calcium channel blocker that can also be used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, but it may not be the best choice in patients with COPD due to potential respiratory side effects.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, the most appropriate treatment for his tachycardia, particularly if he is experiencing atrial fibrillation, would be **Metoprolol (D)**.

The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

This is typically done with a non-contrast CT scan of the head.\n\n5. **Other Considerations**: While checking blood glucose (fingerstick) is important in any altered mental status case to rule out hypoglycemia, the immediate concern here is to assess for a stroke.

        "reason": "This patient with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, deviation of the tongue to the right, left-sided hemiparesis, and decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the left side of his body most likely has a stroke of the right medial medulla. The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome). This leads to lesions to the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Clinically this presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased gag reflex, vomiting, vertigo, decreased pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which presents with ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities, and contralateral loss of light touch and vibration sensation.",

The most likely area affected is the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, which supplies the lateral aspect of the cerebral hemisphere, including areas responsible for motor and sensory functions of the contralateral side of the body.\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) Anterior inferior cerebellar artery: This artery primarily supplies the cerebellum and is less likely to cause the symptoms described.\n   - (B) Anterior spinal artery: This artery supplies the anterior portion of the spinal cord and is not relevant to the symptoms presented.\n   - (C) Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery: These branches supply deep structures of the brain, including the basal ganglia and internal capsule. A stroke here could cause contralateral weakness and sensory loss, which fits the patient's presentation.\n   - (D) Pontine perforators of the basilar artery: These would affect the pons and are less likely to cause the specific symptoms described.\n   - (E) Posterior inferior cerebellar artery: This artery supplies the posterior inferior cerebellum and is not relevant to the symptoms presented.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the left-sided weakness and sensory loss, along with the cranial nerve findings, the most likely artery involved is the lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery (C), as they can cause contralateral motor and sensory deficits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **C**.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with chest pain and an ECG demonstrating hyperacute T waves (leads V2-V6) which is an early finding concerning for a myocardial infarction.\n\nA myocardial infarction occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures causing occlusion of a coronary artery. Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI. The authors note that T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression can before, during, or after the STEMI event. The authors recommend obtaining serial ECGs in patients with suspected STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates hyperacute T waves (blue arrows) that are only occurring in a vascular distribution (V2-V6).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia can present with peaked T waves; however, peaked T waves would be demonstrated in all leads. Other findings of hyperkalemia can include QRS widening. Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias. Repletion with potassium is the preferred treatment, and the magnesium level should be checked as low magnesium can lead to potassium wasting in the kidneys.\n\nAnswer E: Pericarditis presents with chest pain worse by laying back and relieved by leaning forward. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions, and echocardiography may demonstrate a pericardial effusion. Management involves the administration of ibuprofen or colchicine and steroids in refractory cases. However, these therapies should not be used after myocardial infarction.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHyperacute T waves are an early finding that is concerning for myocardial infarction.",

This is a key detail, as certain types of chest pain have specific characteristics.\n\n2. **Associated Symptoms**: The patient also reports shortness of breath and fainting (syncope) after the onset of pain. Syncope can be associated with serious cardiac conditions.\n\n3. **Medical History**: The patient has a history of diabetes and hypertension, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n\n4. **Vital Signs**: The vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and a pulse that is slightly elevated. The oxygen saturation is normal.\n\n5. **Physical Exam Findings**: The physical exam reveals a normal heart sound (S1 and S2) and clear breath sounds, which suggests that there may not be significant heart failure or pulmonary issues at this time.\n\n6. **ECG**: Although the ECG is not provided here, it is crucial in diagnosing cardiac conditions. However, we can still analyze the symptoms and history.\n\n7. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Hyperkalemia (A)**: Typically presents with ECG changes and muscle weakness, not primarily with chest pain and syncope.\n   - **Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (B)**: Can cause exertional chest pain and syncope, but the leaning forward position improving pain is not typical.\n   - **Hypokalemia (C)**: Would not typically present with the symptoms described.\n   - **Myocardial infarction (D)**: Can present with exertional chest pain and syncope, but the pain characteristics (worse when leaning back) are not typical.\n   - **Pericarditis (E)**: Characteristically presents with sharp chest pain that is worse when lying back and relieved by leaning forward, along with possible fever and a pericardial friction rub.\n\nGiven the details, the pain being worse when leaning back and improved when leaning forward strongly suggests pericarditis.

Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose.

It presents as acute onset, painless vision loss, normally in one eye. On fundoscopic exam, classic findings of this disease include venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool exudates, and edema/swelling of the optic disk can be seen. There is no definitive treatment for this disorder but symptomatic treatment includes intravitreal glucocorticoid injections and retinal laser photocoagulation. Retinal vein occlusion may resolve spontaneously or progress to permanent vision loss.\n\nRobinson and Halpern present evidence regarding the treatment of retinal vein occlusion. They discuss how the treatments for the acute phase of this disease have been disappointing. They recommend managing long-term complications such as neovascularization with phototherapy.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a fundoscopic exam showing engorged retinal veins, optic disk swelling, and widespread retinal hemorrhages (red circle). These findings are characteristic of central retinal vein occlusion.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Central retinal artery occlusion can present as sudden onset, unilateral vision loss.

Embolic sources may include carotid artery atherosclerosis or cardiac vegetation. Treatment is with risk factor control.\n\nAnswer B: Closed-angle glaucoma presents as sudden, painful, vision loss caused by increased intraocular pressure. The eye will appear red and often feel \u201chard.\u201d The optic disc will show characteristic cupping. Intraocular pressure will be levated and treatment is with acetazolamide, steroids, timolol, bromidine, and pilocarpine. Irodotomy is reserved for refractory cases.\n\nAnswer C: Papilledema may present as an enlargement in the blind spot and is usually bilateral, as it is caused by increased intracranial pressure. On fundoscopic exam, there will be bilateral optic disk swelling, seen as an elevated optic disk and blurred margins. Patients should undergo a neurologic evaluation to determine the etiology of the papilledema.\n\nAnswer D: Retinal detachment presents as monocular loss of vision, often described as a \u201ccurtain pulled down,\u201d and preceded by \u201cflashers\u201d and \u201cfloaters.\u201d On fundoscopic exam, crinkling of the retinal tissue and abrupt changes in vessel direction can be seen.

Patients should immediately be cooled with external measures and started on fluids. Minor cases where the patient is cognitively intact can be treated with oral replacement with an electrolyte balanced solution (though this would be heat exhaustion and not heat stroke). Patients with altered mental status should be started on normal saline or lactated ringer, and sodium levels should be corrected slowly. Rapid correction of serum sodium or administration of hypotonic fluids can cause cerebral edema and seizures; however, this is more common in hypernatremia that has persisted for days as it has led to cerebral adaptations.\n\nTinawi reviewed the evidence regarding the use of intravenous fluids in the hospital setting. He discusses how a large volume of normal saline can result in hypernatremia and hyperchloremia. He recommends considering the risks and benefits of colloid versus crystalloid usage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1-3: 50% normal saline 50% dextrose, dextrose solution, and hypotonic saline are hypotonic solutions and would treat the hypernatremia too rapidly predisposing the patient to seizures.\n\nAnswer E: Normal saline would be a reasonable option for this patient; however, it is less desirable given that this patient is suffering from hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, and a metabolic acidosis which could be worsened by normal saline given the large sodium and chloride load of this solution.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHypernatremia and dehydration should be treated with lactated ringer and sodium levels should be corrected no more rapidly than 1 mEq/L/hour.",
        "raw_response": "To approach this question, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and laboratory findings of the patient step-by-step.\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 23-year-old man who has altered mental status after running a marathon. He has a high fever (104\u00b0F), tachycardia (pulse of 200/min), tachypnea (respirations of 33/min), and dry mucous membranes, indicating dehydration. His skin is hot and flushed, which could suggest hyperthermia or heat-related illness.\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings**: \n   - **Hypernatremia**: The serum sodium level is 165 mEq/L, which is significantly elevated (normal range is typically 135-145 mEq/L). This indicates hypernatremia, likely due to dehydration.\n   - **Renal Function**: The BUN is elevated (30 mg/dL) and creatinine is slightly elevated (1.5 mg/dL), suggesting possible acute kidney injury, likely secondary to dehydration.\n   - **Other Electrolytes**: Potassium is normal (4.0 mEq/L), and calcium is also normal (10.2 mg/dL).\n\n3. **Assessment**: The patient is likely suffering from hypernatremia due to dehydration, possibly from excessive fluid loss during the marathon without adequate rehydration. The altered mental status and other vital signs suggest he may be experiencing heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\n4. **Management**: The primary goal in this scenario is to correct the hypernatremia and rehydrate the patient. Given the high sodium level, we need to provide fluids that will help lower the sodium concentration safely.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- **(A) 50% normal saline 50% dextrose**: This would provide a hypotonic solution, but the dextrose may not be necessary at this point.\n- **(B) Dextrose solution**: This does not address the hypernatremia effectively.\n- **(C) Hypotonic saline**: This could be appropriate for treating hypernatremia, but it is not the best choice in this acute setting.\n- **(D) Lactated ringer**: This is isotonic and may not effectively address the hypernatremia.\n- **(E) Normal saline**: This is isotonic and would help with rehydration, but it may not be the best choice for correcting hypernatremia.\n\nGiven the need to correct hypernatremia and rehydrate the patient, the most appropriate next step in management would be to use a hypotonic solution to gradually lower the sodium levels.

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin. It can more accurately characterize if a stroke occurred, and the extent of the injury.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe workup of a transient ischemic attack should be centered on a thorough neurological exam, a non-contrast CT scan of the head, and administration of aspirin assuming there is no intracranial bleed.",

This is suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is characterized by temporary neurological deficits due to a brief interruption of blood flow to the brain.\n\n2. **Risk Factors**: The patient has several risk factors for vascular disease, including diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. These conditions increase the likelihood of cerebrovascular events.\n\n3. **CT Scan Results**: The CT scan of the head is unremarkable, which is expected in cases of TIA since there is no permanent damage to the brain tissue at this point.\n\n4. **Management of TIA**: The standard management for a patient who has experienced a TIA includes addressing the risk factors and preventing future strokes. This typically involves antiplatelet therapy (like aspirin) and possibly statin therapy (like atorvastatin) to manage cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular risk.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: Given that the patient has had a TIA, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate antiplatelet therapy to prevent future strokes. Aspirin is commonly used for this purpose.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- (A) Aspirin: This is appropriate for secondary prevention after a TIA.\n- (B) Atorvastatin: While this is also important for managing cholesterol and reducing stroke risk, it is not the immediate next step in acute management.\n- (C) CTA head/neck: This could be considered to evaluate for vascular causes, but the CT scan is already unremarkable, and the patient is symptom-free.\n- (D) Labetalol: This is used for managing hypertension, but the patient's blood pressure is already stable.\n- (E) MRI brain: This may be useful for further evaluation, but it is not the immediate next step after a TIA.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**(A) Aspirin**.",

Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data. The authors found that sickle cell trait is associated with increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy. The authors recommend further evaluation of these associations using prospective studies derived from clinical data.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows gel electrophoresis with an example of a normal (95-98% HbA and < 2% HbF), sickle cell trait (50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF), and sickle cell anemia (85-95% HbS and 5-15% HbF) patient from left to right.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diabetes has not been associated with sickle cell trait in the majority of studies.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is a complication of sickle cell anemia. Mechanisms include functional asplenism, reduced tissue perfusion during a sickle crisis, and chronic transfusions with an indwelling catheter. Common infections include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitis. Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism. Most individuals with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic by age 2 to 4. The spleen subsequently cannot phagocytose encapsulated organisms properly, which predisposes sickle cell patients to infection.\n\nAnswer E: Stroke is a complication of sickle cell anemia but not sickle cell trait. This is due to the increased viscosity of the blood and reduced deformability of red cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSickle cell trait is associated with episodes of painless hematuria.",

Both parents are carriers of the sickle cell gene (HbAS), which means there is a possibility that the child could inherit the sickle cell trait (HbAS) or sickle cell disease (HbSS).\n\n2. **Family History**: The father\u2019s brother died of sickle cell anemia, which suggests a significant risk for complications associated with sickle cell disease in the family.\n\n3. **Testing and Counseling**: The physician is repeating tests for the patient and his sister, likely to determine if the child has sickle cell disease (HbSS) or is just a carrier (HbAS). The results of these tests would guide the physician in counseling the family about potential complications.\n\n4. **Complications of Sickle Cell Disease**: If the patient has sickle cell disease (HbSS), he is at risk for several complications, including:\n   - **Infection**: Children with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for infections, particularly from encapsulated organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae, due to functional asplenia or hyposplenism.\n   - **Stroke**: Sickle cell disease can lead to vaso-occlusive crises and increased risk of stroke, especially in children.\n   - **Splenic Sequestration**: This can occur in sickle cell disease, leading to splenomegaly and potentially requiring splenectomy.\n   - **Hematuria**: This can occur due to renal complications in sickle cell disease.\n   - **Diabetes**: While diabetes can occur in patients with sickle cell disease, it is not a direct complication of the disease itself.\n\n5. **Most Likely Complication**: Given the age of the patient and the common complications associated with sickle cell disease, the most immediate and significant risk is infection due to the compromised immune function related to splenic dysfunction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely complication that the patient may have in the future is:\n\n**(C) Infection**.",

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient is presenting with constant vertigo, ataxia, vomiting, and a head impulse test revealing a corrective saccade, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) exam, which suggests a peripheral etiology of vertigo, most likely vestibular neuritis. As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient\u2019s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.",

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs in almost all patients with MEN2B and is often metastatic at the time of diagnosis. Patients should be screened for pheochromocytoma using plasma fractionated metanephrines at the time of diagnosis of MTC. Intestinal neuromas may also lead to intestinal manifestations such as chronic constipation and megacolon. Treatment is with surgical excision of malignant lesions and active screening for future development of tumors.\n\nCastinetti et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of MEN2B.

Other findings in this disorder include parathyroid and pancreatic tumors. Treatment is with surgical excision of malignant lesions.\n\nAnswer D: Fasting hypoglycemia would suggest the presence of an insulinoma, which is a less common pancreatic tumor that may be seen in MEN1. Other findings in this disorder include parathyroid and pancreatic tumors. Patients with an insulinoma require surgical excision in order to allow for proper glucose homeostasis.\n\nAnswer E: A positive fecal occult blood test would raise suspicion for colorectal cancer, which is a feature of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS).

The most appropriate next step in management is to start an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as lisinopril.\n\nWhen a patient experiences a myocardial infarction, there are certain medications that the patient should be started on that lower mortality. These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction.

        "reason": "This patient's mood changes and findings concerning for subacute combined degeneration (fall in the dark, impaired proprioception, weakness, and brisk patellar reflexes), and history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery are concerning for vitamin B12 deficiency. Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased. It would not present with the abnormal neurologic findings seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRoux-en-Y bariatric surgery increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency via reduction of food intake, decreased functional parietal cell count, and reduced absorption of vitamin B12 (which may cause subacute combined degeneration).",
        "raw_response": "To analyze the case step-by-step, we need to consider the patient's symptoms, medical history, and the implications of her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with mood changes (irritability, anhedonia), sleep disturbances (only 5 hours of sleep), and recent falls. The depressed affect and reduced strength in the lower extremities, along with brisk patellar reflexes, suggest a possible neurological issue.\n\n2. **Medical History**: The patient has generalized anxiety disorder and hypothyroidism, for which she is on escitalopram and levothyroxine. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can lead to malabsorption of various nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.\n\n3. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: After gastric bypass, patients are at risk for deficiencies in vitamin B12, iron, and other nutrients due to altered absorption. Given the symptoms of mood changes and neurological signs (falls, weakness), a deficiency in vitamin B12 could lead to neurological issues and mood disturbances.\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) Poor iron absorption: While this could lead to anemia and fatigue, it is less likely to cause the specific neurological symptoms and mood changes described.\n   - (B) Prior Treponema pallidum exposure: This would be more relevant if there were signs of syphilis, which is not indicated here.\n   - (C) Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin: This could explain mood changes but does not account for the neurological symptoms.\n   - (D) Reduced functional parietal cell count: This could lead to vitamin B12 deficiency due to lack of intrinsic factor, which is common after gastric bypass.\n   - (E) Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose: This could lead to hypothyroid symptoms, but the patient is already on levothyroxine, and her symptoms are more indicative of a nutritional deficiency.\n\nGiven the context of her gastric bypass and the symptoms presented, the most likely cause of her symptoms is:\n\n**(D) Reduced functional parietal cell count** leading to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause both mood changes and neurological symptoms. \n\nThus, the answer is **D**.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a pattern of chest pain (pressure and diaphoresis) that is highly concerning for an acute myocardial infarction. This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome. They recommend aspirin and catheterization in an acute STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an initial ECG with ST depression (blue arrows) followed by pseudonormalization of the ST segment (green arrows) and possibly hyperacute T waves (black arrows), which are concerning for ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac catheterization may be required in this patient; however, if the patient\u2019s chest pain improves or if the troponin is negative, it is unlikely he is having an acute myocardial infarction requiring immediate catheterization. Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 55-year-old man with risk factors for coronary artery disease (diabetes, obesity, and a long history of smoking). He presents with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including chest pressure and diaphoresis, which worsened during physical activity (lifting boxes).\n\n2. **Initial Management**: He has already been given aspirin, which is standard in suspected ACS. An ECG was performed, and the patient was given nitroglycerin, but he experienced minimal improvement in symptoms.\n\n3. **Troponin Level**: A troponin level has been drawn, which is important for diagnosing myocardial injury. Elevated troponin levels would indicate myocardial infarction.\n\n4. **Current Condition**: The patient is still experiencing significant chest pain, and the repeat ECG shows worsening compared to the initial one. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing ongoing ischemia or a more severe cardiac event.\n\n5. **Next Steps in Management**: In cases of suspected myocardial infarction, especially when the patient is still symptomatic and has risk factors, the next step often involves further intervention. \n\n   - **Cardiac Catheterization (A)**: This is often indicated in cases of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or high-risk non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) when there is ongoing chest pain and evidence of ischemia.\n   - **Chest Radiograph (B)**: While useful for ruling out other causes of chest pain (like aortic dissection or pneumothorax), it is not the immediate next step in managing suspected ACS.\n   - **CK-MB Level (C)**: This is less commonly used now since troponin is more specific and sensitive for myocardial injury.\n   - **Heparin (D)**: While anticoagulation is important in the management of ACS, it is typically administered after the decision to proceed with further intervention (like catheterization) is made.\n   - **Repeat ECG in 10 minutes (E)**: While monitoring is important, repeating the ECG without further intervention does not address the ongoing symptoms and risk of myocardial infarction.\n\nGiven the patient's ongoing symptoms, risk factors, and the worsening ECG findings, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**(A) Cardiac catheterization**. \n\nThis allows for direct assessment and potential intervention for any obstructive coronary artery disease that may be causing the patient's symptoms.",

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent. However, it is highly effective in patients who have failed other first-line agents and should still be used in appropriate candidates.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSNRIs are appropriate first-line agents for major depressive disorder in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

He reports weight gain, increased eating and sleeping, loss of interest in activities, feelings of guilt, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms are indicative of depression.\n\n2. **Physical Symptoms**: He also reports burning pain in his legs, which is worse than in the past. The physical exam shows reduced sensation in the lower extremities and electric pain upon touch, suggesting a neuropathic component to his pain, possibly related to his poorly controlled diabetes and peripheral vascular disease.\n\n3. **Mental Health Consideration**: Given the patient's depressive symptoms, we need to consider antidepressant options. The options provided include:\n   - (A) Amitriptyline: A tricyclic antidepressant that is also effective for neuropathic pain.\n   - (B) Bupropion: An atypical antidepressant that is stimulating and may not be the best choice for someone with significant depressive symptoms and weight gain.\n   - (C) Escitalopram: A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat depression and anxiety.\n   - (D) Phenelzine: A monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that is less commonly used due to dietary restrictions and potential side effects.\n   - (E) Venlafaxine: A serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that can also be effective for both depression and neuropathic pain.\n\n4. **Choosing the Best Option**: \n   - Amitriptyline is effective for neuropathic pain and can help with depression, but it may not be the first-line treatment for depression in older adults due to side effects.\n   - Escitalopram is a good choice for treating depression but does not address the neuropathic pain.\n   - Venlafaxine is effective for both depression and neuropathic pain, making it a strong candidate.\n\nConsidering the patient's depressive symptoms and the presence of neuropathic pain, **Venlafaxine (E)** is the most appropriate treatment as it addresses both issues effectively.\n\nThus, the answer is **E**.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).",

He also has a positive urine dipstick for red blood cells, which may indicate hematuria.\n\n2. **Possible Causes of Symptoms**: Given the context of marathon running, the altered mental status, and the seizure, we should consider conditions related to exercise, dehydration, heat-related illness, or metabolic derangements. The high fever could suggest heat stroke or severe dehydration.\n\n3. **Laboratory Testing**: The urine dipstick showing red blood cells could indicate rhabdomyolysis, which is a breakdown of muscle tissue that releases myoglobin into the bloodstream. This condition can occur after intense exercise, especially in hot conditions.\n\n4. **Rhabdomyolysis and Electrolyte Changes**: Rhabdomyolysis is associated with several laboratory findings:\n   - **Hyperkalemia**: Due to the release of potassium from damaged muscle cells.\n   - **Hyperphosphatemia**: Due to the release of phosphate from damaged muscle cells.\n   - **Hyperuricemia**: Can occur due to increased nucleic acid breakdown.\n   - **Hypocalcemia**: Can occur in the acute phase due to calcium binding to damaged muscle tissue.\n   - **Hyponatremia**: Can occur due to excessive fluid intake or dilutional effects, but is less likely in this scenario.\n\n5. **Most Likely Laboratory Finding**: Given the context of marathon running, altered mental status, and the likelihood of rhabdomyolysis, the most common and concerning electrolyte abnormality that would be seen in this patient is **hyperkalemia**.

A common paraneoplastic syndrome in small cell lung cancer is Lambert-Eaton syndrome which presents with muscle weakness that improves with activity and worsens with rest. Activity improves symptoms due to accumulation of calcium with exercise which allows for acetylcholine release. This occurs secondary to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels which decrease acetylcholine release. The diagnosis of Lambert Eaton syndrome can be confirmed with electromyography.

A glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells.\n\nA glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas. This tumor pathologically secretes glucagon leading to profound hyperglycemia that is refractory to the normal treatments for diabetes. Patients also present with a classic rash termed necrolytic migratory erythema which presents with painful, erythematous papules and plaques. Other findings include gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hematologic findings include a normocytic, normochromic anemia.

They are sometimes still used for depression and neuropathic pain. In overdose, TCAs block sodium channels in the heart and cause a pathognomonic QRS widening. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered until the QRS duration normalizes. TCAs also have anticholinergic properties and can cause an anticholinergic toxidrome including delirium, confusion, constipation, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, dry, warm, and flushed skin, and fever.

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial.

Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration).

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with pain upon defecation, constipation, and a fissure lateral to the midline which is suggestive of an anal fissure. Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures. They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery. They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation. It would be inappropriate to only treat this patient symptomatically with a lateral anal fissure as this is a sign of a more serious diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnal fissures that are lateral to the midline require workup for sexually transmitted infections, cancer, and autoimmune disease.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

He has a very low CD4 count (40/mm^3) and a high HIV viral load (115,000 copies/mL) at the time of his previous visit, indicating significant immunosuppression.\n\n2. **Previous Treatment**: He was treated for a right upper lobe lung infiltrate, which suggests a possible opportunistic infection, likely related to his immunocompromised state. After treatment, his CD4 count improved to over 400/mm^3, and his HIV viral load became negligible, indicating a good response to therapy.\n\n3. **Current Symptoms**: Now, he presents with worsening cough, fever, and hemoptysis, along with new findings on chest radiograph showing nodules in the left upper lobe and hilar adenopathy. These findings raise concern for a new pulmonary infection or possibly a reactivation of a previous infection.\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given the patient's history of HIV and the current symptoms, we should consider opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB), fungal infections (like histoplasmosis or cryptococcosis), or even malignancies (like lymphoma). The presence of nodules and hilar adenopathy is particularly concerning for TB, especially in an immunocompromised patient.\n\n5. **Next Steps in Management**: The most appropriate next step in management would be to determine the cause of the new pulmonary findings. This could involve obtaining sputum cultures, including for mycobacteria (to rule out TB) and possibly other pathogens. \n\nNow, let's evaluate the options provided:\n\n(A) Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies - This option does not address the need to investigate the new findings.\n\n(B) Determine drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection - This is a reasonable next step, especially if we suspect TB or another infection that may require specific treatment.\n\n(C) Discontinue antimicrobial treatment - This is not appropriate as the patient is symptomatic and has new findings.\n\n(D) Obtain a D-dimer level - This is not relevant to the current clinical picture.\n\n(E) Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy - This is inappropriate as it would further immunosuppress the patient.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**B) Determine drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection.**",

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.",

This is indicative of a seizure disorder, and the multifocal nature suggests a more complex underlying pathology.\n\n4. **Possible Conditions**: The symptoms and EEG findings are suggestive of a condition known as West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, developmental regression, and a specific EEG pattern known as hypsarrhythmia. \n\n5. **Pathophysiology**: In West syndrome, the underlying pathophysiology often involves abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems, particularly involving GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), which is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. A decrease in GABA levels can lead to increased excitability and seizures.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options provided:\n\n(A) **Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels**: This is associated with absence seizures, not typically with the presentation described.\n\n(B) **Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies**: This is related to autoimmune encephalitis, which does not fit the clinical picture.\n\n(C) **Decreased gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels**: This is consistent with the pathophysiology of infantile spasms and West syndrome, where decreased GABAergic activity leads to increased seizure susceptibility.\n\n(D) **Excess of corticotropin releasing hormone**: This is not directly related to the symptoms or EEG findings.\n\n(E) **Vitamin B6 deficiency**: While it can cause seizures, the specific presentation and EEG findings are more indicative of a different underlying issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C) Decreased gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels**.",

The most appropriate next step in management is emergent escharotomy to restore blood flow.\n\nBurns can be caused by chemical, thermal, electrical, and radiation sources. The initial inflammation causes vasodilatation and hyperemia, which can progress to edema and local microvascular thrombosis. If not promptly addressed, tissue necrosis and irreversible damage can occur. Circumferential burns can evolve into eschars that constrict blood flow and cause distal compartment syndrome. A delta pressure (diastolic pressure minus local compartment pressure) lower than 30 mmHg is diagnostic. In the case of eschar-induced compartment syndrome, the most appropriate next step is escharotomy to alleviate pressure.\n\nOrmiston and Marappa-Ganeshan review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with compartment syndrome. They discuss how this condition can be caused by many different pathologies including burns. They recommend the emergent release of constrictive structures.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amputation may be necessary if the distal limb is completely necrotic and not salvageable. Timely release of the eschar can allow for reperfusion of the limb and prevent this outcome.\n\nAnswer C: Fasciotomy is the treatment of choice for compartment syndrome not due to a circumferential eschar, but in this case the least invasive surgical intervention should be performed first without releasing all the compartments of the lower leg. If escharotomy does not relieve the compartment syndrome then fasciotomy may be required.\n\nAnswer D: Intravenous fluid infusion based on the Parkland formula is part of comprehensive burn management, but would not address the underlying compartment syndrome, which is more urgent at this time.\n\nAnswer E: Transfer to a specialized burn center can be considered since circumferential burns are one of the admission criteria, but early escharotomy should be performed first.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCircumferential burns that cause eschars and compartment syndrome require an escharotomy.",

Patients are often asymptomatic and may present with a white blood cell count > 50,000/mm^3. There are many different presentations. The chronic phase presents with < 10% blasts and is often asymptomatic. The accelerated phase has increased blasts, and patients present with fatigue, weight loss, malaise, night sweats, abdominal pain, and hepatosplenomegaly. Finally, the blast phase presents similar to the accelerated phase but with more severe symptoms. The blast phase may evolve into a blast crisis (> 20% blasts) which could cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. Hypervicosity syndrome may require IV fluids and leukapheresis.

The pathophysiology of HA is vascular ectasia from exposure to OCPs and androgens.\n\nA hepatic adenoma typically occurs secondary to exposure to OCPs and androgens (anabolic steroids) causing a generalized vascular ectasia. Both of these drugs should be discontinued in patients with hepatic adenoma. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Sudden worsening of pain with unstable vitals suggests a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Patients should be managed with fluids and an ultrasound should be performed to support the diagnosis. Additional imaging tests include an abdominal contrast-enhanced CT to better characterize the pathologic anatomy in this disease. The definitive treatment in this disease is surgery in order to remove the hepatic adenoma. In cases of a ruptured hepatic adenomas, patients require transfusion and operative management.\n\nBioulac-Sage et al. present the current data that are available for classifying hepatic adenomas. They discuss how many of these lesions involve alterations of the HNF1A gene, the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and the CTNNB1 gene. They recommend performing molecular analysis in order to better understand which lesions are likely to undergo malignant transformation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ectopic implantation of a blastocyst (ectopic pregnancy) that has ruptured could present similarly to what this patient is experiencing. Symptoms would include lower abdominal pain and unstable vitals. However, this patient's pain is more pronounced in the right upper quadrant and is occurring in the setting of OCP and possible anabolic steroid use.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation of the pancreas represents a diagnosis of pancreatitis. This would present with epigastric pain after a fatty meal or alcohol consumption. Though this patient does drink more than recommended and should be counseled to reduce her consumption, the pain began after exercising at the gym and there are no other symptoms of pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer C: Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein causes Budd-Chiari syndrome, which presents with a non-specific triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly in the setting of a hypercoagulable state (factor V Leiden, polycythemia vera, OCP use, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). Though this patient has risk factors for this pathology, they do not have any classic symptoms.\n\nAnswer D: Obstruction of the common bile duct with radio-opaque stones would present with colicky right upper quadrant pain in a patient that is \"fat, female, fertile, and forty.\" Though the pain presented in this case is localized to the right upper quadrant, it is not colicky and there is not a positive Murphy sign described. OCP's are a risk factor for cholesterol stones as are rapid weight loss, both of which this patient has. This is a strong possibility on the differential; however, the symptoms presented suggest a diagnosis of ruptured hepatic adenoma given the demographics of the patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA hepatic adenoma presents with right upper quadrant pain in the setting of OCP and/or androgen use and can rupture leading to unstable vitals.",

Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with urticaria whenever she engages in sexual intercourse suggesting a latex allergy (found in condoms). These allergies are due to antigen exposure.\n\nAnaphylaxis and urticaria are immunologically mediated responses to environmental antigens that are typically IgE-mediated. This results in crosslinking of antigen receptors and the subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory signals. Patients can present with a spectrum of symptoms from urticaria (hives alone) all the way to full-blown anaphylaxis (hypotension, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction). Minor cases can be treated with avoidance of antigen exposure. Anaphylaxis is treated with intramuscular epinephrine (1:1,000).\n\nGawchik reviewed the evidence regarding the diagnosis of latex allergy. She discusses how the diagnosis is primarily made by observing the relationship between exposure and symptoms. She recommends avoidance of latex in these patients.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph that demonstrates dermal edema and urticaria (red circles). This can occur secondary to allergen exposure such as from a new drug or latex.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Drug reaction could be possible if this patient has an antibiotic allergy (ceftriaxone is a treatment for gonorrhea); however, a rash that only occurs during intercourse is more likely related to latex exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is possible given this patient\u2019s IV drug abuse and risky behavior; however, the hives present in this patient are likely not related to an infection. Infectious rashes tend to be painful, ulcerative, or vesicular.\n\nAnswer D: IV drug use could expose this patient to any number of foreign substances that could induce an allergic reaction; however, the symptoms that are associated with sexual intercourse point toward latex exposure.\n\nAnswer E: Photosensitivity would not present as hives but could occur in this patient given that doxycycline is an appropriate drug to treat her initial sexually transmitted infection and offers coverage for Chlamydia trachomatis.

        "raw_response": "To determine the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient History**: The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of unprotected intercourse with multiple partners, which raises the suspicion for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). She also has a history of IV drug abuse and depression, and she consumes alcohol regularly.\n\n2. **Initial Presentation**: She presented with abnormal vaginal discharge, which led to her being treated with antibiotics. This suggests a possible bacterial infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia or gonorrhea.\n\n3. **Follow-Up Symptoms**: Three days after starting treatment, she presents with a rash that appears every time she has sex. This timing is crucial as it suggests a reaction to something that occurs during sexual activity.\n\n4. **Rash Characteristics**: While the specific characteristics of the rash are not described in the question, the fact that it occurs consistently with sexual activity suggests a possible allergic reaction or sensitivity rather than an infectious process.\n\n5. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) **Antigen exposure**: This could refer to an allergic reaction to something encountered during sexual activity, such as latex in condoms or other allergens.\n   - (B) **Drug reaction**: This is a possibility, especially if the antibiotics she was given could cause a rash, but the timing with sexual activity makes this less likely.\n   - (C) **Infection**: While infections can cause rashes, the specific timing with sexual activity points away from this being the primary cause.\n   - (D) **IV drug use**: This could lead to infections or other complications, but it does not directly explain the rash related to sexual activity.\n   - (E) **Photosensitivity**: This typically refers to a rash that occurs in response to sunlight, which does not correlate with the symptoms described.\n\nGiven the context of the rash appearing specifically after sexual activity, the most likely cause is an allergic reaction to an antigen encountered during sex, such as latex or another substance.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:\n\n**(A) Antigen exposure**.",

The most appropriate next step is to repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir.\n\nHealthcare exposures to HIV are divided into 2 categories based on the level of contact with the source patient. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, immediate prophylaxis is recommended. This category also includes all needlestick exposures. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects. Prophylactic treatment should be initiated immediately (ideally within 1-2 hours) and continued for 4 weeks at which time the healthcare worker\u2019s serology should be repeated.\n\nParikh et al. studied technologies for monitoring HIV infection. They discuss how high throughput methods are required in order to surveil for infection on a population level. They recommend using next-generation sequencing methods to improve surveillance methods.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Immediately initiating triple antiretroviral therapy is appropriate after drawing the medical student\u2019s HIV serology. The patient\u2019s serology at the time of exposure must be established to compare to future testing. Despite her previous negative serology and low-risk lifestyle, it would still be best to repeat the testing at the same time prophylactic treatment is initiated.\n\nAnswer B: Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results is incorrect because this option would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Empiric treatment with a triple antiretroviral drug combination is appropriate for all patients with high-risk exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Waiting to hear that the medical student\u2019s HIV serology is negative would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Triple antiretroviral drug treatment should be initiated without waiting for the results. Empiric treatment of all patients with high-risk exposure is recommended in all cases.\n\nAnswer D: Waiting for the results of the medical student\u2019s serology would delay treatment for her exposure. If her serology is already positive, she will need to be treated past the 4-week period of prophylaxis. Even though she does not engage in high-risk behaviors, a positive serology would demonstrate that she was already infected with HIV.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAfter a needlestick injury from a HIV-positive source patient, a healthcare worker\u2019s HIV serology should be drawn and they should be immediately initiated on triple antiretroviral drug therapy.",

The source patient has a high viral load (1,800,000 copies/mL), which increases the risk of HIV transmission.\n\n2. **Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV is most effective when started as soon as possible after exposure, ideally within hours. The standard recommendation is to initiate PEP within 72 hours of exposure.\n\n3. **Source Patient's HIV Status**: The source patient has a recent diagnosis of HIV and has just started highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 3 days ago. However, the high viral load indicates that the virus is still present in significant quantities, which poses a risk for transmission.\n\n4. **Medical Student's HIV Status**: The medical student has a negative HIV serology from the beginning of medical school and has no known risk factors for HIV other than this exposure.\n\n5. **Next Steps in Management**: The standard protocol for managing needlestick injuries from HIV-positive patients includes:\n   - Assessing the source patient's HIV status (which is known here).\n   - Initiating PEP as soon as possible, regardless of the medical student's current HIV status, since she has had a significant exposure.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **Immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy**: This is appropriate given the high risk of transmission from the source patient, but it does not specify the need for serology testing first.\n\n(B) **Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results**: This is not necessary in the acute setting of a needlestick injury.\n\n(C) **Repeat HIV serology and initiate triple antiretroviral therapy if negative**: This is not appropriate because PEP should be initiated regardless of the medical student's current HIV status.\n\n(D) **Repeat HIV serology and initiate triple antiretroviral therapy if positive**: This is not appropriate as it delays treatment.\n\n(E) **Repeat HIV serology and initiate triple antiretroviral therapy immediately**: This option suggests starting PEP immediately while also considering the medical student's current HIV status, which is a reasonable approach.\n\nGiven the urgency of the situation and the high risk of transmission, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**(E) Repeat HIV serology and initiate triple antiretroviral therapy immediately.**",

Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers. They found that about many had confirmed infections. They recommend against empiric treatment without prior confirmation of infection.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Crypt abscesses are found on histology in ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients can also experience musculoskeletal pain, uveitis, and dermatologic findings such as erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum. Treatment may include mesalazine.\n\nAnswer B: A mucosal defect in the stomach is the pathologic description of a gastric ulcer. This patient\u2019s presentation of epigastric pain that improves with the consumption of food is more consistent with an ulcer in the duodenum.

Rheumatoid arthritis can present with fever, weight loss, and joint pain that worsens in the morning and improves with activity. It is common for the joints of the hands to become deformed due to the disease process. Treatment is with methotrexate.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are likely positive in this patient; however, they are not more likely to aid in making the diagnosis than anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies are. ANA are non-specific and can be found in many rheumatological conditions such as MCTD, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAnswer E: Anti-Ro antibodies are found in Sjogren syndrome which presents with dry eyes, dry mouth, dental caries, and dyspareunia. A salivary gland biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes artificial tears, vitamin D supplementation, and pilocarpine or cevimeline.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMixed connective tissue disease is associated with anti-ribonuleoprotein antibodies and presents with Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia/arthritis, swollen hands, sclerodactyly, and myositis.",

Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, management of viral meningitis consists of supportive care and monitoring for complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or SIADH.\n\nKohil et. al review viral meningitis.

The presence of neck pain and fever raises suspicion for meningitis.\n\n2. **Neurological Exam**: The absence of focal neurological deficits is noted, but the pain with passive neck flexion suggests meningeal irritation, which is consistent with meningitis.\n\n3. **CSF Analysis**: The CSF results show:\n   - Cell count: 175/mm^3 (elevated, indicating inflammation)\n   - RBCs: 0/mm^3 (no blood, which is important to rule out a hemorrhagic process)\n   - Chloride: 119 mEq/L (normal range)\n   - Glucose: 49 mg/dL (normal range; typically, in bacterial meningitis, glucose is low)\n   - Total protein: 55 mg/dL (elevated, but not extremely high)\n\n4. **Interpretation of CSF Results**: The elevated white blood cell count with a normal glucose level and a moderate increase in protein suggests a viral or atypical bacterial infection rather than classic bacterial meningitis. The normal glucose level is particularly telling, as it is often low in bacterial meningitis.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given the clinical presentation and CSF findings, viral meningitis is a strong possibility.

The most appropriate treatment for these conditions is valproic acid.\n\nAbsence seizures classically present with cessation of motor activity and speech with a blank facial expression and occasionally automatisms such as flickering of the eyelids. They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer. It carries the potentially severe side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is not a first-line treatment for absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Stevens-Johnson syndrome will present with painful desquamation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAbsence seizures present with periods of inattentiveness and subtle automatisms and are most appropriately treated with ethosuximide or with valproic acid if there is concurrent juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

The weakness is significant (2/5 strength in upper and lower extremities), which suggests a neuromuscular issue. The rash on her face and arms is also notable.\n\n2. **Medical History**: The patient has a history of well-controlled diabetes and has experienced hypoglycemia, which indicates she is on insulin and metformin. The recent treatment for an ear infection with antibiotics and the subsequent rash could suggest a drug reaction, but the rash's characteristics and the weakness point towards a different etiology.\n\n3. **Physical Exam Findings**: Sparse fine hair and the rash are important. The weakness and rash together could indicate a myopathy, particularly one associated with autoimmune conditions.\n\n4. **Laboratory Values**: The lab results show normal sodium, slightly low potassium (3.3 mEq/L), normal glucose, and normal liver function tests. The potassium level is noteworthy as it is low, which could contribute to muscle weakness.\n\n5. **Muscle Biopsy**: Although we do not have the image of the biopsy, the context suggests that it is likely indicative of an inflammatory myopathy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) **Dermatomyositis**: This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and a distinctive rash (heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules). The patient's rash and weakness fit this diagnosis well.\n\n(B) **Hypokalemia**: While the patient has low potassium, hypokalemia alone does not explain the rash or the significant muscle weakness.\n\n(C) **Hypothyroidism**: This can cause weakness and fatigue, but it typically does not present with a rash or the specific muscle weakness seen here.\n\n(D) **Inclusion body myositis**: This condition usually occurs in older adults and presents with progressive weakness, but it typically does not have a rash associated with it.\n\n(E) **Polymyositis**: This is similar to dermatomyositis but does not have the characteristic rash.

        "reason": "The thymus gland (labeled in A) is visible on a chest radiograph in infants and will change in response to illness due to its immunologic role.\n\nThe thymus gland is the site of T-cell maturation. The thymus is visible on a chest radiograph in infants and continues to grow throughout childhood. It is located in the anterior part of the superior mediastinum. On a chest radiograph, the thymus may appear as a \u201cwidened mediastinum,\u201d continuous with the superior border of the heart (Figure A) or as a triangular-shaped opacity known as the thymic \u201csail sign,\" located towards the right of the mediastinum. At puberty, the gland will decrease in size and eventually be replaced by fatty tissue.\n\nAskin and Young review the evidence regarding the history and function of the thymus. They discuss how this structure is involved in immune function. They recommend monitoring for the absence of this structure in immunodeficient patients.\n\nFigure A shows a normal chest radiograph of an infant with a normal cardiothymic contour.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: B points to the trachea. Deviation of this structure can be seen in patients with tension pneumothorax. Treatment is with needle thoracostomy followed by chest tube placement.\n\nAnswer C: C points to the apex of the heart. This structure can be enlarged in congenital heart conditions. Treatment is with surgical correction of these conditions.\n\nAnswer D: D points to the stomach. This structure can be abnormal in patients with pyloric stenosis. Treatment is with pyloromyotomy.\n\nAnswer E: E points to the diaphragm. This structure can be abnormal in patients with diaphragmatic hernias. Treatment is with surgical closure of the defect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe thymus is normally visible on a pediatric chest radiograph, but it is replaced by fatty tissue after puberty.",
        "raw_response": "To answer the question, we need to analyze the scenario step-by-step and consider the implications of the patient's recent history and the structures labeled in the chest radiograph.\n\n1. **Patient Background**: The 6-month-old girl had a recent hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia, which indicates that she has had an infectious illness that affected her lungs. She has since recovered and is back to her usual state of health.\n\n2. **Follow-Up**: The question mentions a follow-up chest radiograph taken 4 weeks after her hospitalization. This suggests that the radiograph is likely showing the status of her lungs post-infection.\n\n3. **Understanding the Structures**: Without seeing Figure A, we can infer that the labeled structures likely include components of the respiratory system (like the lungs, bronchi, etc.) and possibly other structures in the thoracic cavity (like the heart, mediastinum, etc.).\n\n4. **Response to Infection**: In the context of another infectious illness, the structures that would most likely change would be those directly involved in the respiratory process. This includes the lungs, which can show changes such as consolidation, atelectasis, or other signs of infection.\n\n5. **Identifying the Most Likely Structure**: \n   - If we assume that the options correspond to different parts of the lung or respiratory system, the structure that would most likely change in response to another infectious illness would be the lung tissue itself (often labeled as \"A\" or \"B\" in radiographs).\n   - Structures like the heart (if labeled as \"D\" or \"E\") would not typically change in response to a respiratory infection.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the most likely structure to change in response to another infectious illness would be the lung tissue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely **(A)**, assuming that \"A\" corresponds to the lung structure in the radiograph.",

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a distended, tender abdomen with a radiograph demonstrating the \"coffee bean sign,\" likely has a cecal volvulus.\n\nCecal volvulus is the second most common cause of volvulus after sigmoid volvulus and presents with abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, abdominal distention, and a tympanitic abdomen. It is more common in young patients who are active (e.g. marathon runners). The classic conventional radiographic finding in cecal volvulus is the coffee bean sign, in which closed loops of intestine distend with gas, making visible the medial and lateral walls of dilated bowel. Diagnosis of cecal volvulus can be confirmed with a CT scan. Management involves analgesia, intravenous fluids, and surgical detorsion.\n\nHasbahceci et al. review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of cecal volvulus. The authors find that abdominal radiography has a low sensitivity for cecal volvulus. The authors recommend surgical management of cecal volvulus with resection with right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a radiograph demonstrating the \"coffee bean\" sign which is suggestive of a cecal volvulus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ileus presents after surgery or manipulation of the intestines with decreased peristalsis of the intestine leading to a failure to pass gas or have bowel movements. Treatment involves treating any electrolyte abnormalities, encouraging ambulation, and avoiding medications that decrease peristalsis (such as opioids).\n\nAnswer C: Ogilvie syndrome occurs when the colon wall is not appropriately undergoing peristalsis leading to a dilated colon with abdominal distension. It is more common in the elderly and critically ill patients. Treatment involves the placement of a rectal tube to decompress the intestines and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Sigmoid volvulus is more common in elderly and critically ill patients and presents with constipation, an absence of bowel movements, and a distended, tympanitic abdomen. Although the coffee bean sign may also be seen in patients with sigmoid volvulus, patients tend to be older. In addition, plain radiography typically demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels in a sigmoid volvulus versus usually only a single air-fluid level in a cecal volvulus. Treatment involves flexible sigmoidoscopy and surgery.\n\nAnswer E: Small bowel obstruction presents with a distended and tympanitic abdomen with nausea, vomiting, and an absence of flatus or bowel movements. Radiography may demonstrate distended bowel and air-fluid levels, and the most accurate test is a CT scan of the abdomen. It occurs secondary to adhesions entrapping the bowel. Management involves the placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous fluids, and surgery.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCecal volvulus presents in younger patients with abdominal pain, distention, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and the \"coffee bean\" sign on radiography.",

These symptoms are common in various gastrointestinal conditions.\n\n2. **Context**: The symptoms began towards the end of a marathon, which suggests that they may be related to physical exertion or dehydration, common in endurance sports.\n\n3. **Physical Exam Findings**: The patient has a distended and tender abdomen. This is significant as it indicates some form of obstruction or significant gastrointestinal issue.\n\n4. **Vital Signs**: The elevated pulse (113/min) could indicate pain, anxiety, or a compensatory response to a potential underlying issue, such as dehydration or an obstructive process.\n\n5. **Radiograph**: Although we do not have the visual of Figure A, we can infer that the radiograph likely shows signs of obstruction or distension, which would help narrow down the diagnosis.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) **Cecal volvulus**: This condition involves twisting of the cecum and can cause abdominal pain and distension. It is less common than sigmoid volvulus.\n\n(B) **Ileus**: This is a temporary cessation of bowel activity, which can cause distension and pain but is often associated with a lack of bowel sounds and is less likely to present acutely after exercise.\n\n(C) **Ogilvie syndrome**: This is a form of colonic pseudo-obstruction, typically seen in older patients or those with significant comorbidities, which does not fit this young, otherwise healthy patient.\n\n(D) **Sigmoid volvulus**: This is a twisting of the sigmoid colon, leading to obstruction. It is more common in older adults but can occur in younger individuals, especially in the context of increased intra-abdominal pressure or straining.\n\n(E) **Small bowel obstruction**: This could also present with similar symptoms and abdominal distension, but the context of the marathon and the nature of the pain may suggest a more localized issue.\n\nGiven the age of the patient, the context of physical exertion, and the symptoms of abdominal distension and tenderness, the most likely diagnosis is **sigmoid volvulus (D)**.

The increased PTH results in renal phosphate wasting, increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and increased renal calcium reabsorption. It also results in increased osteoclast activity resulting in increased bone breakdown.

This patient does not have metabolic alkalosis. Treatment is with the discontinuation of the offending agent.\n\nAnswer B: Increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D occurs in sarcoidosis which presents with cough, fatigue, and weight loss in an African American woman.

Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.",

She is on medications that include clopidogrel and aspirin, which are used to prevent clotting.\n\n3. **Physical Exam Findings**: The patient has an irregular heartbeat, which is a key finding. Irregular heartbeats can be indicative of arrhythmias, which can arise from various parts of the cardiac conduction system.\n\n4. **ECG Findings**: Although we do not have the actual ECG figure to analyze, the presence of an irregular heartbeat often suggests issues with the atrioventricular (AV) node or the sinoatrial (SA) node. \n\n5. **Understanding the Cardiac Conduction System**:\n   - **Sinoatrial (SA) Node**: The natural pacemaker of the heart, responsible for initiating the heartbeat.\n   - **Atrioventricular (AV) Node**: Acts as a gatekeeper, controlling the electrical signals from the atria to the ventricles.\n   - **Bundle of His**: Conducts impulses from the AV node to the bundle branches.\n   - **Bundle Branches**: Conduct impulses through the right and left ventricles.\n   - **Purkinje Fibers**: Distribute the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles.\n\n6. **Analysis of Irregular Heartbeat**: Given that the patient has an irregular heartbeat and considering her age and history of myocardial infarction, it is likely that the irregularity is due to a problem with the AV node. Conditions such as atrial fibrillation or other types of heart block can lead to irregular heart rhythms and are more common in patients with a history of heart disease.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on the irregular heartbeat and the patient's history, the most likely affected component of the cardiac conduction system is the **Atrioventricular node (AV node)**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n**(A) Atrioventricular node**.",

        "reason": "This patient who presents with poorly managed hypertension over a long period of time most likely has compensatory hypertrophy of the heart. The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber. Treatment is with diuresis and treatment of the underlying heart failure.\n\nAnswer D: A holosystolic murmur heard at the apex describes mitral valve regurgitation. This would be possible if a papillary muscle had ruptured in an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment is with mitral valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer E: A normal S1 and S2 is possible but is less likely given this patient's long-standing history of poorly managed hypertension. Hypertension usually causes concentric hypertrophy of the ventricle and thereby leads to increased resistance to diastolic filling.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAn S4 heart sound is created by blood entering a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle and is often heard in patients with long-standing hypertension.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the expected cardiac findings on physical exam for this 69-year-old man, we need to analyze his clinical presentation and medical history.\n\n1. **Patient's Background**: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, depression, obesity, and a myocardial infarction (MI) 7 years ago. These conditions can lead to various cardiac changes.\n\n2. **Current Symptoms**: The patient presents with significantly elevated blood pressure (180/120 mmHg), which indicates possible hypertensive crisis or poorly controlled hypertension. This can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) over time, which can affect heart sounds.\n\n3. **Heart Sounds**: \n   - **S1 and S2**: These are the normal heart sounds. S1 corresponds to the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves, while S2 corresponds to the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves.\n   - **Fixed Splitting**: This is typically associated with conditions like atrial septal defect (ASD) and is not common in patients with hypertension or post-MI.\n   - **Heart Sound after S2**: This could indicate a third heart sound (S3), which is often associated with heart failure or volume overload, but the patient does not show signs of heart failure in the provided information.\n   - **Heart Sound before S1**: This could indicate a fourth heart sound (S4), which is often associated with decreased ventricular compliance, commonly seen in patients with hypertension or ischemic heart disease.\n   - **Holosystolic Murmur at the Apex**: This is typically associated with mitral regurgitation, which is not indicated in this case.\n   - **Normal S1 and S2**: This would suggest no significant abnormalities in heart function.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's history of hypertension and myocardial infarction, it is likely that he has developed some degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, which could lead to an S4 heart sound due to decreased compliance of the left ventricle. \n\nTherefore, the most likely expected finding on physical exam would be:\n\n**(C) Heart sound before S1** (indicating an S4 heart sound).",
        "thinking": "The patient's history of hypertension and previous myocardial infarction indicates potential cardiac changes, specifically left ventricular hypertrophy, which is often associated with an S4 heart sound. Since the question asks for the expected finding on physical exam, the correct option refers to this heart sound before S1, indicating diminished ventricular compliance.",

Fresh frozen plasma is the most effective therapy for hereditary angioedema of the options listed.\n\nAngioedema is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with severe edema of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. It can be caused by antigens, medications, and trauma or may occur spontaneously. It often presents with notable edema of the lips and tongue and may threaten the airway. There are 3 subtypes. Hereditary and acquired angioedema occur secondary to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. As a result, the most effective therapy is to administer fresh frozen plasma which has C1-esterase inhibitor. On the other hand, drug-induced angioedema (often from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) does not respond well to C1-esterase inhibitor replacement and supportive therapy; discontinuing the offending agent is the mainstay of therapy. Other effective but costly treatments that can be used in hereditary angioedema include: icatibant, ecallantide, and C1 inhibitor.\n\nPaige and Anderson note the management of hereditary angioedema. They review the different treatments and discuss C1-esterase inhibitor replacement. They recommend this treatment for acute episodes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Dexamethasone and other steroids can be given in acute allergic reactions and may reduce the recurrence of symptoms but are unlikely to be effective in angioedema, nor are they the most effective therapy. Steroids can take up to 4 hours to begin having any effect.\n\nAnswer B: Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that could be given for anaphylaxis or urticaria and works immediately; however, it is not the mainstay of therapy for angioedema nor is it the most effective therapy. It is the mainstay of therapy for urticaria. It can also be given in anaphylaxis.\n\nAnswer C: Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis which presents with urticaria, upper airway swelling, hypotension, nausea/vomiting, and wheezing. It is often given in angioedema but has limited efficacy when compared to fresh frozen plasma.\n\nAnswer E: Tranexamic acid is effective in treating angioedema and current evidence supports its use; however, the mainstay of therapy is still fresh frozen plasma. Tranexamic acid is also used in hemorrhagic shock to stop fibrinolysis and reduce bleeding.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA possible treatment in hereditary or acquired angioedema is the administration of fresh frozen plasma to replace C1-esterase inhibitor.",

The clear breath sounds and normal oxygen saturation suggest that while he is having difficulty breathing, he may not yet be in respiratory distress.\n\n4. **Vital Signs**: The vital signs are stable, which is a good sign, but the presence of swelling and difficulty speaking indicates that the airway could be compromised.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given the acute onset of symptoms following trauma and the swelling, this could be an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or non-allergic angioedema. However, the absence of a rash and the specific symptoms point more towards angioedema rather than anaphylaxis.\n\n6. **Treatment Options**:\n   - **Dexamethasone (A)**: This is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation but is not the first-line treatment for acute airway swelling.\n   - **Diphenhydramine (B)**: This is an antihistamine that can help with allergic reactions but is not sufficient for acute airway swelling.\n   - **Epinephrine (C)**: This is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and can also be effective in severe cases of angioedema, especially if there is a risk of airway compromise.\n   - **Fresh frozen plasma (D)**: This is used for coagulopathy and is not relevant here.\n   - **Tranexamic acid (E)**: This is used to reduce bleeding and is not indicated in this scenario.\n\nGiven the acute nature of the symptoms, the risk of airway compromise, and the history of similar episodes, the most effective therapy for this patient is **C) Epinephrine**.

The most appropriate initial therapy is light therapy, behavioral therapy, and sleep hygiene practices in addition to decreasing exposure to light at night.\n\nDelayed sleep phase syndrome typically presents with individuals who naturally fall asleep very late and wake up very late. This becomes problematic when they attend school or have a job that requires them to wake up early. The most appropriate initial therapy for delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene practices, and bright light therapy. Bright light therapy involves consistent timed exposure to a light box to simulate natural outdoor light, with the hope of resetting the circadian rhythm and moving the sleep phase earlier. If these measures fail, or if a different diagnosis is suspected, a referral for polysomnography may be indicated.\n\nSletten et al. studied whether melatonin was effective in the treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome. They found that using this medication as an adjunct to sleep hygiene was effective in improving symptoms. They recommend using multimodal therapy for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ethosuximide is the treatment of choice for absence seizures. Though this patient does have episodes of blank staring, this likely does not represent a seizure as he is arousable to return to work by his boss. Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy. Though this patient does have sudden episodes of falling asleep while at work, this is more likely to be related to his sleep schedule. Patients with narcolepsy generally do not feel tired immediately before their episodes of sleep.\n\nAnswer E: Zolpidem is a muscle relaxant and hypnotic with the mechanism of action of a benzodiazepine. Though a drug like zolpidem could be used to help this patient fall asleep, the most appropriate first step is to address the patient's sleep hygiene prior to prescribing a potentially addictive drug.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep hygiene.",
