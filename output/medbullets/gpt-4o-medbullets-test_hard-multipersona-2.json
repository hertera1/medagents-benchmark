He states the pain is constant and is primarily located on his right side. When asked to indicate the area of pain, he says that it surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/91 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient\u2019s right eye is shown in Figure A.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden-onset unilateral vision loss and an orbitofrontal headache with a dilated pupil and a hard ocular globe suggesting a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",

The pain is constant, located on the right side, and surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He also has a history of hypertension and is on hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n2. **Symptoms Analysis**:\n   - **Headache and Nausea**: These are common symptoms that can be associated with various conditions, including migraines, cluster headaches, or more serious conditions like glaucoma or a cerebrovascular event.\n   - **Pain Location**: The pain is primarily around the eye and upper forehead, which can be indicative of cluster headaches or acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n   - **Visual Symptoms**: Difficulty seeing out of the right eye and excessive tearing could suggest an ocular issue.\n   - **Physical Examination**: The right pupil is minimally responsive to light, and the globe feels firm, which is a key finding. A firm globe can indicate increased intraocular pressure, commonly seen in acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n   - **Carotid Bruit**: This finding suggests turbulent blood flow, possibly due to carotid artery stenosis, which can increase the risk of cerebrovascular events.\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma**: The firm globe, minimally responsive pupil, and visual symptoms strongly suggest this condition.\n   - **Cluster Headache**: While the pain location and tearing could fit, the firm globe and minimally responsive pupil are not typical findings.\n   - **Migraine**: The symptoms do not fully align with a typical migraine, especially the firm globe and pupil findings.\n   - **Cerebrovascular Event**: The carotid bruit is concerning, but the ocular findings are more specific to glaucoma.\n\n4. **Most Appropriate Prophylaxis**:\n   - **Acetazolamide**: This is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to reduce intraocular pressure in conditions like acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n   - **Amitriptyline**: This is a tricyclic antidepressant used for migraine prophylaxis, not suitable for acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n   - **Clopidogrel**: This is an antiplatelet agent used for preventing strokes and heart attacks, not directly relevant to acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n   - **Epinephrine**: This is used in emergency situations like anaphylaxis, not for glaucoma.\n   - **Verapamil**: This is a calcium channel blocker used for cluster headache prophylaxis, not suitable for acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n### Answer\n\n**A. Acetazolamide**\n\n**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma.

He was outside tending to his lawn for several hours in the heat, when he stood up suddenly from pulling weeds and fainted. He denies any preceding symptoms and returned to baseline within 1 minute. The patient is not aware of any medical problems and just started seeing a primary care physician last week. He recently used a friend's prescription for ondansetron for nausea. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg, pulse is 107/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals intact cranial nerves, normal strength and sensation, and a stable gait. His abdomen is soft and nontender. An ECG is performed as seen in Figure A.

        "answer_idx": "D",
        "reason": "This patient is presenting after syncope, likely secondary to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension given his outdoor gardening in the heat and symptoms when standing up rapidly. The patient\u2019s ECG reveals deep, pathologic Q waves, which in this case are an incidental finding indicative of a previous myocardial infarction or a previous ischemic event.\n\nThe Q wave is a negative deflection just prior to the R wave. Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI. They recommend testing such as cardiac MRI to assess for previous infarction in the appropriate patient population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating pathologic Q waves (red arrows). Note the deep and wide Q waves; this raises concern for a past ischemic event.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute myocardial infarctions would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG with possible reciprocal depressions. While T wave inversions may be indicative of new or acute ischemia, deep pathologic Q waves without ST elevation are indicative of previous infarction.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia would cause U waves on ECG, which appear as a small, \"second T wave\" after the initial T wave. Note they are not U-shaped despite their name. Management is centered on repletion of potassium and often magnesium as well.\n\nAnswer C: Intermittent torsades de pointes can cause syncope and should be suspected in a patient with syncope in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This patient\u2019s QT interval is not particularly prolonged, and his syncope seems to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Management is centered on cessation of QT-prolonging medications and magnesium administration. Note that while ondansetron does prolong the QT interval, it is unlikely to cause torsades given the patient took it a week ago.\n\nAnswer E: Pulmonary emboli would present on ECG with sinus tachycardia in addition to pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia. Note that the ECG is a nonspecific test for pulmonary emboli, and CT angiography is the preferred confirmatory test for this condition. Syncope is a possible presentation of larger pulmonary emboli (though the patient would also be hemodynamically unstable).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPathologic Q waves are indicative of a previous myocardial infarction.",

                "### Updated Thinking\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 67-year-old man who fainted after standing up suddenly while working in the heat. He denies any preceding symptoms and returned to baseline within 1 minute. This suggests a transient event rather than a prolonged or ongoing issue.\n\n2. **Vital Signs and Physical Exam**: His vital signs show a slightly elevated pulse (107/min) but otherwise normal parameters. The physical exam is unremarkable, with no signs of neurological deficits or abdominal issues.\n\n3. **Medication History**: The patient recently used ondansetron, which is known to prolong the QT interval. This is a significant clue as QT prolongation can lead to torsades de pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n\n4. **ECG Findings**: The ECG (Figure A) would be crucial in identifying the specific arrhythmia. Given the context, we would expect to see evidence of QT prolongation or torsades de pointes.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**: Typically presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and other systemic symptoms. The absence of these symptoms and the transient nature of the episode make AMI less likely.\n   - **Hypokalemia**: Can cause arrhythmias but would typically present with other symptoms and lab findings. The history does not suggest a cause for hypokalemia.\n   - **Intermittent Torsades de Pointes**: Fits well with the use of ondansetron and the sudden fainting episode. Torsades de pointes is often transient and can resolve spontaneously, which matches the patient's quick recovery.\n   - **Previous Myocardial Ischemia**: Would not typically cause a sudden fainting episode without other symptoms or a history of cardiac issues.\n   - **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**: Usually presents with shortness of breath, chest pain, and other systemic symptoms. The absence of these makes PE less likely.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\nBased on the patient's history, the use of ondansetron, and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**(C) Intermittent torsades de pointes**\n\nThis diagnosis is supported by the patient's use of a medication known to prolong the QT interval, the sudden onset of symptoms, and the quick resolution of the episode.

However, the use of ondansetron, a medication known to prolong the QT interval, raises the suspicion of a cardiac arrhythmia, particularly torsades des pointes.\n\n2. **Medication History**: Ondansetron is known to prolong the QT interval, which can predispose patients to torsades des pointes, a specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can cause syncope and is often self-terminating.\n\n3. **ECG Findings**: Although the specific ECG image is not provided here, the experts have reviewed it and concluded that it supports the diagnosis of intermittent torsades des pointes. This arrhythmia is characterized by a prolonged QT interval and a distinctive twisting of the points on the ECG.\n\n4. **Absence of Other Symptoms**: The patient does not report chest pain, respiratory distress, or other symptoms that would suggest acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or other critical conditions.

        "reason": "This patient presents following a motor vehicle accident with a tender abdomen and stable vital signs. Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding. This stable patient with a benign exam can undergo a CT scan, which will offer more data than a FAST exam and would be performed regardless of whether a FAST exam was positive or negative given this patient's intoxication and abdominal bruising.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient who has experienced blunt abdominal trauma the most appropriate initial step in a stable patient is an abdominal CT scan.",

However, the presence of abdominal bruising raises concern for possible internal injuries, which need to be assessed promptly to guide further management.\n\nThe Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam is a rapid, non-invasive ultrasound examination used in trauma settings to detect free fluid (which may indicate internal bleeding) in the peritoneal, pericardial, and pleural cavities. It is particularly useful in stable trauma patients as it can be performed quickly at the bedside, providing immediate information that can help determine the need for further imaging or surgical intervention.\n\nOther options such as abdominal and chest CT (A) provide detailed imaging but are more time-consuming and involve radiation exposure. Diagnostic laparoscopy (C) and diagnostic peritoneal lavage (D) are invasive procedures that are not indicated as the first step in a stable patient. A chest radiograph (B) is useful for evaluating thoracic injuries but does not address the primary concern of potential intra-abdominal bleeding.\n\nTherefore, considering the patient's condition and the need for a rapid, non-invasive assessment, the FAST exam is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nFinal answer: (E) Focused abdominal sonography for trauma exam",

Given that he is stable, a non-invasive and rapid assessment method is preferred. The FAST exam is specifically designed for this purpose in trauma situations. Other imaging options would be more invasive or less targeted to the immediate concerns of internal bleeding. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is the FAST exam."

The next step in management is topical antibiotics.\n\nAcne vulgaris is caused by blockage or outlet obstruction of the pilosebaceous unit. It presents with erythema, pustules, and comedones typically in young men going through puberty. Risk factors include stress, excessive sweating, greasy skin care products, and steroid use. The management of acne vulgaris, in order, is to start with topical benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and isoretinoin. It is important to try a therapy for a proper duration before switching to a more invasive therapy.\n\nEichenfield et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of patients with acne vulgaris. They discuss how this disease can be treated with benzoyl peroxide. They recommend using antibiotics or isotretinoin for refractory cases.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating diffuse comedones over the forehead (red circle). These findings are classically seen in patients with acne vulgaris.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Continuing current therapy for 1 more month is unnecessary as this patient's symptoms have not improved at all with 1 month of therapy. Continuing current therapy would be appropriate if the patient had only tried therapy for a few days.\n\nAnswer B: Dietary interventions have not been shown to improve outcomes in acne vulgaris. Stopping illicit substances such as performance enhancing steroids can be effective in reducing acne symptoms but there is no evidence this patient has been using steroids.\n\nAnswer C: Isoretinoin is the last-line therapy for acne vulgaris. It should not be given to pregnant women as it is teratogenic. Women taking isoretinoin should be on reliable birth control. Topical and oral antibiotics should be used first.\n\nAnswer D: Oral antibiotics would be indicated after topical antibiotics fail.

                "### Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Patient's Condition**\n- The patient is a 17-year-old male with persistent facial lesions since age 13.\n- The lesions have not improved with home remedies.\n- The physical exam findings (Figure A) are not provided, but we can infer that the lesions are likely consistent with acne given the context and common presentation in this age group.\n\n**Step 2: Current Treatment and Response**\n- The patient was started on benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids.\n- After 1 month, there has been no significant improvement in symptoms.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n- **(A) Continue current therapy for 1 more month:** While it is true that topical treatments can take time to show results, the patient has already been on this regimen for a month without improvement. It may be reasonable to consider an additional month, but this option may not be the most aggressive or effective next step.\n  \n- **(B) Dietary intervention:** The patient has a diet high in refined carbohydrates and has gained weight. While diet can influence acne, dietary changes alone are unlikely to be the most effective immediate intervention for moderate to severe acne.\n\n- **(C) Isoretinoin:** Isotretinoin is a powerful systemic retinoid used for severe or refractory acne. Given that the patient has not responded to initial topical treatments, this could be a consideration, but it is typically reserved for more severe cases or after other treatments have failed.\n\n- **(D) Oral antibiotics:** Oral antibiotics are often used for moderate to severe acne that does not respond to topical treatments. They can help reduce inflammation and bacterial load. This option seems appropriate given the lack of response to initial topical therapy.\n\n- **(E) Topical antibiotics:** The patient is already on topical treatments (benzoyl peroxide and retinoids). Adding topical antibiotics might help, but oral antibiotics are generally more effective for more extensive or resistant cases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Step 4: Making a Decision**\n- Given the patient's lack of response to initial topical treatments and the need for a more effective intervention, oral antibiotics (Option D) are a reasonable next step. They are commonly used for moderate to severe acne and can provide a more systemic approach to reducing inflammation and bacterial load.\n\n### Answer\n\n**D) Oral antibiotics**",

        "reason": "This patient who presents with failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral cataracts most likely has classic galactosemia. Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding. The author notes that there are safety concerns with regards to the high phyto-estrogenic isoflavone content of these formulas. The author recommends that despite these safety concerns, these formulas should still be used in patients with classic galactosemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods would be effective in the treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance. This disease presents similarly to classic galactosemia, but cataracts would not be seen in patients with this disease.\n\nAnswer C: Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement would be effective in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, associated findings in this disease would be anemia and avascular necrosis of the bones.\n\nAnswer D: Removing phenylalanine from the maternal diet during pregnancy would be effective in the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, these patients classically present with a \"musty smell\" and eczema.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 supplementation may be effective in mitigating the negative symptoms of homocystinuria. This disease may also present with cataracts or lens dislocations. Associated findings in this disorder would be marfanoid appearance and arachnodactyly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with classic galactosemia should not be breastfed and should receive a galactose-free and lactose-free diet such as soy-based formulas.",

Changing to a soy-based formula**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The symptoms of jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral cataracts in a 4-week-old infant are indicative of congenital galactosemia.\n- The appropriate intervention to manage and prevent the symptoms of galactosemia is to eliminate galactose from the diet.\n- Soy-based formulas do not contain lactose or galactose, making them the most suitable option for infants with galactosemia.\n- Therefore, changing to a soy-based formula could have avoided this patient's symptoms by preventing the intake of galactose.",
                "### Updated Thinking\n\nBased on the clinical presentation of the 4-week-old boy, the symptoms of jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and bilateral lens clouding are highly indicative of galactosemia. Galactosemia is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in one of the enzymes needed to convert galactose into glucose. The most common form is due to a deficiency in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT).\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Jaundice and Hepatosplenomegaly**: These symptoms are consistent with liver dysfunction, which is a hallmark of galactosemia due to the accumulation of toxic substances in the liver.\n2. **Weight Loss**: Poor feeding and weight loss are common in infants with galactosemia because they cannot properly metabolize galactose, leading to energy deficiency.\n3. **Bilateral Lens Clouding**: Cataracts are a classic sign of galactosemia, resulting from the accumulation of galactitol in the lens of the eye.\n\n### Intervention:\nThe primary treatment for galactosemia is the elimination of galactose from the diet. This involves avoiding all lactose-containing foods, as lactose is broken down into glucose and galactose. Soy-based formulas are recommended because they do not contain lactose or galactose, making them suitable for infants with galactosemia.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **(A) Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods**: This is not relevant to galactosemia, as these foods do not contain significant amounts of lactose or galactose.\n- **(B) Changing to a soy-based formula**: This is the correct intervention. Soy-based formulas do not contain lactose or galactose, which are harmful to infants with galactosemia.\n- **(C) Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement**: This is used for Gaucher disease, not galactosemia.\n- **(D) Removing phenylalanine from maternal diet during pregnancy**: This is relevant for phenylketonuria (PKU), not galactosemia.\n- **(E) Vitamin B6 supplementation**: This is not relevant to the management of galactosemia.\n\n### Updated Answer:\n**(B) Changing to a soy-based formula**\n\nThis intervention would have avoided the patient's symptoms by eliminating the intake of lactose and galactose, thereby preventing the toxic accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate and galactitol in the body.",

The family cannot recall the types of pill bottles that they found and did not bring them to the ED. The patient's medical history is notable for anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She is currently not on any medications. She was given an exercise program but she has not been compliant with these exercises.

        "answer_idx": "D",
        "reason": "This patient is presenting with acute acetaminophen intoxication. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting. In general, syrup of ipecac is the wrong answer choice for all toxicity cases.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAcetaminophen toxicity should be treated immediately with N-acetyl cysteine followed by further diagnostic workup including serum acetaminophen levels.",

DLCO is the one parameter that is normal in these episodes.\n\nAsthma is an obstructive lung disease that results in intermittent episodes of respiratory compromise. Asthma presents with shortness of breath typically secondary to an allergen/antigen or with exposure to exercise or cold air that causes bronchospasm. Pulmonary function testing will typically reveal a decreased FEV1, a decreased FVC, and a decreased FEV1/FVC in both asthma and emphysema. The DLCO will be normal in asthma in contrast to emphysema where the DLCO is decreased. Patients should be treated with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids for acute exacerbations.\n\nPeng et al. review the evidence regarding patients who have COPD versus asthma. They discuss how patients with COPD have reduced DLCO. They recommend measuring parameters to distinguish between these entities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Decreased airway tone does not describe asthma. Rather, hyperreactive airways with increased tone describes an asthma attack. Decreased airway tone may be seen in patients with connective tissue diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nAnswers 2-4: Increased FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FVC do not describe asthma. All of these laboratory values are decreased in asthma and emphysema. Increased respiratory performance can be seen in patients who are athletes or training for marathons.\n\nBullet Summary:\nBoth asthma and emphysema present with a decreased FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC; however, asthma has a normal DLCO while COPD has a reduced DLCO.",

The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis. She does not report symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (joint pain/stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with use).\n\nBullet Summary:\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis is treated with alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate).",

The patient states that his last drink was more than 1 year ago. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/78 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a non-tender, non-distended abdomen. Laboratory studies are notable for a serum calcium of 7.0 mg/dL. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is performed as seen in Figure A. A Sudan Black stain of the patient\u2019s stool is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea?",

        "reason": "This patient with a history of alcoholism is presenting with steatorrhea (foul-smelling diarrhea that stains with Sudan Black, a stain that detects fat in the stool), hypocalcemia, and findings suggestive of chronic pancreatitis on CT scan (inflammatory changes and calcification). His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism. This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea. Treating the underlying cause in addition to rifaximin will eliminate the excess bacteria.\n\nBullet Summary:\nProton pump inhibitors should be given in patients with persistent diarrhea in the setting of chronic pancreatitis to prevent the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with unilateral upper extremity paresthesia and weakness suggestive of compression of the neurovascular structures of the upper extremity secondary to an apical lung tumor.\n\nAn apical lung tumor can compress the neurovascular structures in its proximity and cause pain, numbness, and weakness of the ipsilateral arm. A Horner syndrome can also be observed with compression of the sympathetic chain leading to ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis in some cases. These malignancies typically occur in older male smokers and can be associated with symptoms such as fatigue, cough, and weight loss. Chest radiography will demonstrate an apical opacity and CT scan can confirm the size and location of the mass. Treatment is with chemotherapy and surgical excision of the tumor.\n\nDavis and Knight review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with apical lung tumors. They discuss how these tumors can be associated with brachial plexus injuries. They recommend surgical excision of these tumors if they are resectable.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Brachial plexopathy could present with weakness and numbness of the ipsilateral arm but is a less likely diagnosis (and a diagnosis of exclusion). Treatment is with identification and surgical release of any underlying anatomic defects (such as compressive bands) and supportive therapy if none are found.\n\nAnswer C: Cerebral infarction (stroke) would present with sudden onset of acute neurological deficits. These would typically only affect one side of the body and would not necessarily be associated with a dull pain or numbness that is chronic. Treatment is with thrombolytics if patients meet criteria for acute therapy.\n\nAnswer D: Scalenus anticus syndrome occurs in bodybuilders or athletes with hypertrophied neck muscles that compress the brachial plexus. Symptoms are typically worsened by certain positions. Treatment is with physical therapy and surgical decompression in refractory cases.\n\nAnswer E: Subclavian steal syndrome presents with numbness, tingling, weakness in a limb, and CNS symptoms (vertigo, slurred speech, or stroke-like symptoms) that are worsened with activity and relieved with rest.

Consideration of Apical Lung Tumor (Pancoast Tumor)\n- **Risk Factors**: Significant smoking history and weight loss are concerning for malignancy.\n- **Symptoms**: Chronic weakness, sensory changes, and pain in the right arm could be due to a Pancoast tumor compressing the brachial plexus or other structures.\n- **Physical Exam**: The presence of dull aching and burning pain in the right arm is consistent with nerve involvement, which could be due to a Pancoast tumor.\n\n#### C. Consideration of Brachial Plexopathy\n- **Symptoms**: Weakness and sensory changes in the right arm could be due to brachial plexopathy. However, the chronicity and the presence of pain suggest a more insidious process.\n- **Physical Exam**: The findings are consistent with brachial plexopathy, but the significant weight loss and smoking history point towards a more serious underlying cause like a tumor.\n\n#### D. Consideration of Scalenus Anticus Syndrome\n- **Symptoms**: This condition typically presents with symptoms exacerbated by certain positions, which is not the case here.\n- **Physical Exam**: The lack of positional changes in symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely.\n\n#### E. Consideration of Subclavian Steal Syndrome\n- **Symptoms**: This condition usually presents with symptoms related to arm exertion and vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which are not described here.\n- **Physical Exam**: The findings do not support this diagnosis.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\nGiven the patient's significant weight loss, history of heavy smoking, and the chronic nature of his symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is an **apical lung tumor (Pancoast tumor)**. This diagnosis aligns well with the patient's risk factors and clinical presentation, including the chronic weakness, sensory changes, and pain in the right arm.\n\n**Answer: (A) Apical lung tumor**",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with unilateral upper extremity paresthesia and weakness suggestive of compression of the neurovascular structures of the upper extremity secondary to an apical lung tumor.\n\nAn apical lung tumor can compress the neurovascular structures in its proximity and cause pain, numbness, and weakness of the ipsilateral arm. A Horner syndrome can also be observed with compression of the sympathetic chain leading to ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis in some cases. These malignancies typically occur in older male smokers and can be associated with symptoms such as fatigue, cough, and weight loss. Chest radiography will demonstrate an apical opacity and CT scan can confirm the size and location of the mass. Treatment is with chemotherapy and surgical excision of the tumor.\n\nDavis and Knight review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with apical lung tumors. They discuss how these tumors can be associated with brachial plexus injuries. They recommend surgical excision of these tumors if they are resectable.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Brachial plexopathy could present with weakness and numbness of the ipsilateral arm but is a less likely diagnosis (and a diagnosis of exclusion). Treatment is with identification and surgical release of any underlying anatomic defects (such as compressive bands) and supportive therapy if none are found.\n\nAnswer C: Cerebral infarction (stroke) would present with sudden onset of acute neurological deficits. These would typically only affect one side of the body and would not necessarily be associated with a dull pain or numbness that is chronic. Treatment is with thrombolytics if patients meet criteria for acute therapy.\n\nAnswer D: Scalenus anticus syndrome occurs in bodybuilders or athletes with hypertrophied neck muscles that compress the brachial plexus. Symptoms are typically worsened by certain positions. Treatment is with physical therapy and surgical decompression in refractory cases.\n\nAnswer E: Subclavian steal syndrome presents with numbness, tingling, weakness in a limb, and CNS symptoms (vertigo, slurred speech, or stroke-like symptoms) that are worsened with activity and relieved with rest. Treatment is with vascular intervention to restore blood flow.\n\nBullet Summary:\nApical lung tumors can compress neurovascular structures in the upper extremity and cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the ipsilateral arm.",

Of the answer choices given, angiodysplasia is the most likely to cause such profuse and sudden bleeding.\n\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly in the colon. The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. The authors note that angiodysplasias are the cause of many \"occult\" GI bleeds not visualized on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. The authors recommend the use of capsule endoscopy in occult GI bleeds to identify angiodysplasias as a potential source.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Erosion into a gastric vessel is the pathophysiology of a bleeding gastric vessel secondary to peptic ulcer disease. This usually presents with melena (black tarry stools) rather than bright red blood per rectum. Only in cases of extremely brisk upper GI bleeding would patients present with bright red blood per rectum. Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Diverticulosis presents with bright red blood and is possible in this patient, but it does not involve inflammation or infection, which defines diverticulitis.\n\nAnswer C: Malignancy or colon cancer can present with bright red blood per rectum, malaise, weight loss, and microcytic anemia. While it is possible in this patient, his age, lack of risk factors for colon cancer, and the sudden onset of his symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.\n\nAnswer D: Submucosal esophageal (Mallory-Weiss) tear presents after profuse vomiting (as in this patient) with bloody vomitus.

Empiric IV antibiotic therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam is the most appropriate initial management.\n\nPasteurella multocida is a gram-negative rod that is associated with cat and dog bites. Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen. Antibiotics can then be narrowed down accordingly. Patients will often require between 4-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment. MRSA coverage may initially be started and tapered later once cultures result.\n\nMollitt reviews the evidence regarding the microbiology of various injuries. He discusses how Pasteurella multocida is a common complication of animal bites. He recommends early effective antibiotic treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answer:\nAnswer A: Amoxicillin and clavulanate can be used to treat Pasteurella infection. Patients with osteomyelitis should not be treated with oral antibiotics initially, in particular, when there are systemic manifestations as is present in this patient. IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam are the mainstay for empiric osteomyelitis treatment after an animal bite in a patient with systemic manifestations.\n\nAnswer C: Doxycycline is used to treat uncomplicated chlamydia infections. Gonococcal osteomyelitis may present in sexually active individuals and may be associated with septic arthritis. Sexually active patients may be suspected of having this disease.\n\nAnswer D: Fluconazole is an antifungal that is used to treat Candida osteomyelitis. Candida osteomyelitis would be highly unusual in patients with no other risk factors. Instead, this disease is more common in immunodeficient patients or those who use IV drugs.\n\nAnswer E: Vancomycin is used for MRSA infections. Although S. aureus is the most common overall cause of osteomyelitis, this patient with a recent animal bite most likely has Pasteurella infection and this organism should be covered accordingly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with suspicion of Pasteurella osteomyelitis infection after an animal bite should be treated with empiric IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam.",

Consideration of Antibiotic Coverage:**\n- **Ampicillin and sulbactam**: Effective against many bacteria associated with cat bites, including Pasteurella multocida and some Staphylococcus species, but not reliably effective against MRSA.\n- **Vancomycin**: Effective against MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria, making it a strong candidate for severe infections where MRSA is a concern.\n- **Amoxicillin and clavulanate**: Broad-spectrum coverage including Pasteurella multocida, but not sufficient for MRSA.\n- **Doxycycline**: Effective against some bacteria from cat bites but not typically first-line for pediatric osteomyelitis.\n- **Fluconazole**: Antifungal, not relevant for bacterial osteomyelitis.\n\n**C. Critical Analysis:**\n- Given the severity of the infection (osteomyelitis) and the need to cover MRSA, the antibiotic choice must be effective against both common cat bite pathogens and MRSA.\n- Vancomycin is specifically noted for its efficacy against MRSA, which is a critical consideration in this case.\n- While ampicillin and sulbactam are effective against many bacteria from cat bites, they do not cover MRSA, which is a significant limitation in this scenario.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\n**The most appropriate next step in management is:**\n\n**(E) Vancomycin**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Vancomycin provides coverage against MRSA, which is a crucial consideration in severe infections like osteomyelitis.\n- The patient's presentation and MRI findings indicate a severe infection that requires broad-spectrum coverage, including MRSA.\n- While ampicillin and sulbactam are effective against many pathogens from cat bites, they do not cover MRSA, making vancomycin the more suitable choice in this case.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure (CHF). The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications. They recommend assessing BNP levels in patients who are suspected of having CHF.\n\nFigure A is a chart with changes in brain natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, sodium, and potassium that would be seen in various diseases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, and high potassium does not reflect the changes that would be seen in CHF. Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF. This pattern would be seen in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH where excessive resorption of free water results in hemodilution.\n\nAnswer E: Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and normal potassium reflect the findings in a healthy patient. This patient most likely has CHF, which would result in increased aldosterone and ADH function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCommon lab findings in heart failure include elevated BNP, elevated ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",

Patients with homocystinuria are also at an increased risk of thromboembolic events that disproportionally affect the cerebral vessels. Similar to Marfan syndrome, patients have phenotypic features of a Marfanoid habitus, including tall stature, long limbs, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, pectus deformity, and scoliosis. Treatment includes vitamin B6 supplementation.\n\nHasan et al. review the evidence regarding diseases associated with homocystinuria. They discuss how this disease is associated with cancer and Alzheimer disease. They recommend screening for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aortic dissection is a complication of Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene. It is also associated with elevated homocysteine levels. Although Marfan syndrome shares many features with homocystinuria, the fair complexion, and intellectual disability seen in this patient are specific to homocystinuria. Treatment involves avoidance of contact sports and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer B: Medullary thyroid cancer is part of the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B), which is caused by a mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. Patients with MEN2B present with Marfanoid habitus, but they do not present with the other features described in this vignette, including fair complexion, intellectual disability, and downward lens subluxation. Treatment is with surgical excision of tumors.\n\nAnswer C: Osteoarthritis is a complication of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Although patients with EDS may present with many of the phenotypic features of both Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria, patients are much less likely to have lens subluxation. Osteoarthritis may be seen with higher incidence in patients with homocystinuria. Treatment is with brace support of unstable joints.\n\nAnswer E: Wilms tumor is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a pediatric overgrowth disorder usually caused by a mutation at chromosome 11p15. BWS presents with macrosomia (\u201cgigantism\u201d), which is defined as height and weight > 97th percentile.

        "question": "A 43-year-old man presents to the emergency department acutely with altered mental status. He uses intravenous drugs and is unable to offer a history. He was found unconscious in a park. His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 80/40 mmHg, pulse is 156/min, and respirations are 26/min. Physical exam reveals an obtunded man covered in vomit, with track marks on his arm and several skin abscesses. The patient is given 4 liters of Ringer lactate and intravenous antibiotics. As the fourth liter of fluids is finishing, the patient is noted to have jugular venous distension and an oxygen saturation of 92% on nonrebreather. He is subsequently intubated. An ECG is obtained as seen in Figure A. The patient is started on norepinephrine, and his blood pressure is subsequently found to be 85/44 mmHg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

            "A": "Cardioversion",
            "B": "Epinephrine",

        },
        "answer_idx": "B",
        "reason": "This patient who uses intravenous drugs with skin abscesses (the likely source of his infection) is hypotensive and tachycardic, with a blood pressure that is not responding to IV fluids; this is concerning for septic shock. Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor). Finally, the fourth line vasopressor for septic shock is phenylephrine.\n\nLevy et al. review sepsis. They update the Surviving Sepsis campaign which gives the most up to date management guidelines of sepsis including adequate fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors. They recommend early antibiotics and resuscitation to minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia. Note the presence of P waves (red arrows highlighting several examples) that are present throughout all leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardioversion would be appropriate in an unstable patient with unstable vital signs in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation would present with an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Cardioversion would not be indicated in sinus tachycardia.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone is a potent glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid properties. While giving an IV steroid may have a permissive effect on blood pressure (via upregulating alpha-1 receptors on the vasculature) there is no reason that this patient would have a low cortisol level (such as in chronic steroid use). Epinephrine is a better answer in this case, though steroids can be considered. Steroids are typically reserved for patients failing at least 2 vasopressors (unless they have a known cortisol-deficient state).\n\nAnswer D: Normal saline is unlikely to benefit this patient as he has already been sufficiently fluid resuscitated. Moreover, it seems the patient may be developing pulmonary edema (hypoxia, jugular venous distension), a sign of fluid overload.\n\nAnswer E: Phenylephrine is the fourth line vasopressor and is an alpha-1 agonist. It is much less potent than norepinephrine and epinephrine, and would not be started in the management of septic shock until the patient has received epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn septic shock, the vasopressors given (in order) are norepinephrine, epinephrine/vasopressin, then phenylephrine.",

Cardioversion:**\n   - Not indicated as there is no mention of a specific arrhythmia requiring cardioversion.\n\n**B. Epinephrine:**\n   - **Updated Thinking:** Given the patient's persistent hypotension despite norepinephrine, epinephrine is a reasonable next step. It can enhance cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, which is crucial in managing refractory septic shock.\n\n**C. Hydrocortisone:**\n   - **Updated Thinking:** Hydrocortisone is also a valid option, especially if there is suspicion of adrenal insufficiency contributing to the refractory shock. It can help address relative adrenal insufficiency and improve hemodynamic stability.\n\n**D. Normal saline:**\n   - Not indicated due to signs of fluid overload.\n\n**E. Phenylephrine:**\n   - Less preferred compared to epinephrine in this scenario due to its limited effect on cardiac output.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth epinephrine and hydrocortisone are reasonable next steps in the management of this patient with refractory septic shock. However, given the immediate need to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics, **epinephrine (B)** is the most appropriate next step as it can rapidly enhance cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.

        "final_raw_response": "Given the clinical scenario of a 43-year-old man with refractory septic shock, persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, and norepinephrine administration, the most appropriate next step in management needs to be carefully considered.\n\nThe patient has received significant fluid resuscitation (4 liters of Ringer lactate) and is on norepinephrine, yet his blood pressure remains low (85/44 mmHg). This indicates that the initial vasopressor therapy is insufficient to stabilize his hemodynamic status. The presence of jugular venous distension and a low oxygen saturation suggests that the patient may be developing fluid overload or cardiogenic shock, but the primary issue remains refractory septic shock.\n\nThe options provided are:\n(A) Cardioversion\n(B) Epinephrine\n(C) Hydrocortisone\n(D) Normal saline\n(E) Phenylephrine\n\n**Rationale for each option:**\n- **Cardioversion (A):** This is typically used for arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. The patient's ECG findings and clinical presentation do not suggest an arrhythmia that would be treated with cardioversion.\n- **Epinephrine (B):** Epinephrine is a potent vasopressor and inotrope that can increase cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. It is often used in cases of refractory septic shock when initial vasopressor therapy (e.g., norepinephrine) is inadequate.\n- **Hydrocortisone (C):** This can be used in septic shock, particularly if there is suspicion of adrenal insufficiency. However, the immediate need is to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics, and hydrocortisone would not provide the rapid hemodynamic support required in this acute setting.\n- **Normal saline (D):** Additional fluid resuscitation is unlikely to be beneficial at this point, given the patient's jugular venous distension and potential fluid overload.\n- **Phenylephrine (E):** This is a pure alpha-agonist that increases vascular resistance but does not have the inotropic effects of epinephrine. It may not be as effective in improving cardiac output in this scenario.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe most appropriate next step in management for this patient with refractory septic shock and persistent hypotension despite norepinephrine is to administer epinephrine. This choice is supported by both the Innovative Medical Thinker - MD and the Critical Medical Analyst - Medical Professor, who both recognize the need for a potent vasopressor and inotrope to stabilize the patient's condition.\n\n**Final Answer: B (Epinephrine)**",
        "final_thinking": "The patient is in refractory septic shock with persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine administration, indicating that initial treatment is ineffective. Given the options, epinephrine stands out as the most appropriate next step because it provides both vasopressor and inotropic support, which is crucial for stabilizing the hemodynamics in this scenario."

Physical exam demonstrates pain on palpation of the right lower quadrant and mild pain in the right upper quadrant. He has significant acne on his face, chest, and back. A CT of the abdomen confirms appendicitis. The scan also shows a large liver mass measuring 6 cm as seen in Figure A.

        "reason": "This patient with a history of possible anabolic steroid use (wrestler with acne) who presents with right upper quadrant pain and an enhancing lesion in the liver most likely has a hepatic adenoma. The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma. They found that various molecular groups have been identified allowing for subtyping of these lesions. They recommend performing a CT scan to better characterize these lesions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT with an enhancing mass with a hypoattenuating fatty component. This is characteristically seen in large hepatic adenomas, which are solitary well-marginated lesions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole would be an effective treatment if this patient had contracted Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food or water on his recent trip to Mexico. While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma. If an adenoma is on the differential, biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of rupture and hemorrhage intraoperatively.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHepatic adenomas are benign, vascular liver masses associated with oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids that should be promptly resected if large and symptomatic.",

This will help in determining the nature of the mass (benign vs. malignant) and guide further management.\n   - Other options such as administering metronidazole or sofosbuvir are not appropriate without a confirmed diagnosis of an infectious etiology.\n   - Follow-up CT in 3 months is not appropriate given the size and potential seriousness of the mass.\n   - Liver mass resection is premature without a definitive diagnosis.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\n**D) Perform liver mass biopsy**\n\n### Rationale\n\n- **Performing a liver mass biopsy** is the most appropriate next step in management after addressing the patient's appendicitis. This approach aligns with the need for a definitive diagnosis to determine the nature of the liver mass, which is crucial for guiding further treatment. The patient's risk factors and the size of the mass necessitate prompt and accurate diagnostic evaluation."

        "reason": "This postpartum patient is presenting with hypertension, headache, blurry vision, and abdominal pain, which are concerning for a diagnosis of preeclampsia. The most appropriate initial intervention is magnesium.\n\nPreeclampsia classically presents after 20 weeks gestation (or earlier in the setting of a molar pregnancy) with hypertension and proteinuria. Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure. Further care involves blood pressure control and benzodiazepines as needed to abort seizure episodes (though note that if a patient with preeclampsia is having seizures, by definition, they have eclampsia).\n\nAl-Safi et al. discuss preeclampsia and eclampsia. They note that postpartum preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur within the first week after delivery. They recommend that mothers should be educated on what symptoms to look for.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT head may be indicated, in particular, if an intracranial hemorrhage was thought to be the cause of this patient\u2019s headache and vision changes. A subarachnoid hemorrhage would present with the classic \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache with blood in the subarachnoid space on head CT. A CTA may localize a bleeding aneurysm and a lumbar puncture would show an elevated red blood cell count in the CSF. It would not explain this patient\u2019s hypertension and abdominal pain. Note that a CT head is not a CTV which is specific venous imaging.\n\nAnswer B: Labetalol is an appropriate blood pressure medication to give in pregnancy; however, it is more appropriate to first give magnesium as this agent is neuroprotective and is the first-line agent of choice in preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer D: MRV head or a CTV head would be appropriate in the workup of cerebral venous thrombosis which is common in the setting of hypercoagulability (such as in the postpartum period) and presents with headache, blurry vision, and seizures. Note that it would not explain this patient\u2019s profound hypertension. It would be more reasonable to first empirically treat this patient's possible preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer E: Ondansetron and morphine would be appropriate symptomatic management of this patient but would not treat her underlying preeclampsia. It is more appropriate to first treat the life-threatening diagnosis before symptom management. If this patient\u2019s hypertension was thought to be due to pain, then morphine could be helpful.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPreeclampsia can occur in the postpartum period and should be managed with magnesium sulfate.",

The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin). Though this is a potent antibiotic combination, neither of these takes priority over clindamycin given the possible benefit of toxin suppression from clindamycin. In this patient, clindamycin and piperacillin-tazobactam would be an appropriate antibiotic regimen.\n\nBullet Summary:\nClindamycin may suppress toxin production and should be given early in toxic shock syndrome.",

This is an ominous finding and suggests a diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) though it may also be seen in other infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis or after ischemic events. ARVD is an autosomal dominant condition where there is fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall predisposing the patient (classically younger patients) to sudden cardiac death from lethal ventricular dysrhythmias. The epsilon wave is the most specific finding; however, other findings include T wave inversion in V1-V3 or a left bundle branch appearance with frequent premature ventricular complexes among other possibilities. This is a potentially lethal diagnosis and requires management with antiarrhythmics (such as beta-blockers or amiodarone) and the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\nKayser et al. review AVRD.

ECG typically shows a characteristic coved-type ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3.\n   - **Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)**: Genetic condition causing thickening of the heart muscle, leading to obstruction of blood flow and arrhythmias. Often presents with exertional syncope.\n   - **QT prolongation**: Can lead to torsades de pointes and syncope. ECG would show prolonged QT interval.\n   - **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome**: Characterized by an accessory pathway leading to pre-excitation of the ventricles.

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients.

This murmur typically occurs in elderly patients and the retrograde flow through the aorta cause a number of physical exam findings. These include a wide pulse pressure, fingernail pulsations, head bobbing, and femoral artery murmur.

He discusses how Duroziez sign can often be seen in patients with this disease. He recommends using these signs to properly identify patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: An audible click heard at the cardiac apex describes mitral valve prolapse which typically is asymptomatic and presents in younger women. Treatment is with surgical valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer C: A murmur that radiates to the carotids during systole describes aortic stenosis which is possible in this patient except for the fact that his murmur is diastolic. Treatment is with valvuloplasty or with surgical valve replacement.\n\nAnswer D: A rumbling heard at the cardiac apex describes mitral valve stenosis which presents with a diastolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. Treatment is with valvuloplasty or with surgical valve replacement.\n\nAnswer E: A wedge pressure lower than expected would be seen in tricuspid regurgitation.

This aligns with option (C).\n\n4. **Consideration of Patient's Age and Cardiovascular History**:\n   - Elderly patients with hypertension are at higher risk for aortic stenosis, which is a common cause of systolic murmurs in this demographic.\n   - However, the murmur described is diastolic, which is more characteristic of mitral stenosis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the diastolic nature of the murmur and its location, mitral stenosis is a plausible diagnosis. The rumbling sound at the cardiac apex is a hallmark of mitral stenosis. Although aortic stenosis is common in elderly patients with hypertension, it typically presents with a systolic murmur, not a diastolic one.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\n(D) Rumbling heard at the cardiac apex"

This type of murmur is typically associated with aortic regurgitation. The Innovative Medical Thinker - MD highlights that a 'pistol-shot' sound over the femoral arteries is characteristic of aortic regurgitation, which aligns with the femoral artery murmur (option B). This is a key finding in aortic regurgitation and supports the diagnosis.\n\nOn the other hand, the Critical Medical Analyst - Medical Professor and the Clinical Decision Specialist - Medical Researcher both suggest that the murmur described as a 'rumbling' sound heard at the cardiac apex is characteristic of mitral stenosis (option D). However, the description of the murmur in the question does not specifically mention a 'rumbling' quality, which is more indicative of mitral stenosis.\n\nGiven the description of the murmur as occurring after S2 and the location over the left sternal border, aortic regurgitation is more likely. The femoral artery murmur is a well-known associated finding in aortic regurgitation, which further supports this diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate additional finding related to the patient's condition is:\n\n(B) Femoral artery murmur\n\nThis conclusion is based on the alignment of the murmur characteristics with aortic regurgitation and the associated clinical findings.",

It presents with stupor/obtundation, bradycardia, hemodynamic instability, and hypothermia. With a high clinical suspicion, appropriate history, physical exam, and vitals, it is appropriate to first treat the patient with IV hydrocortisone (or another highly potent steroid) and levothyroxine prior to confirming the diagnosis given the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Triiodothyronine is given in some circumstances as well (in more ill patients) but is less dire than first giving levothyroxine.

He states that he has been working in a hot, humid attic all day and forgot his water bottle. He felt dizzy when standing up and then fainted and was unconscious for roughly 1 minute. He awoke at his neurologic baseline afterwards. The patient has a history of hypertension being managed by his primary care doctor. His temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 149/82 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a diaphoretic man. He demonstrates an unremarkable cardiopulmonary exam. The patient walks with a steady gait and his neurologic exam is non-focal.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with dizziness and syncope in the setting of likely dehydration (working in a hot/humid environment without water) and feels better after rehydration, suggesting a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block. Note the left axis deviation as suggested by the net upward deflection of the QRS in lead I and net downward deflection in lead II (blue arrows). Then, note the appearance of a right bundle branch block with the RSR pattern in aVR (black arrow) and upward R\u2019 in lead V1 (green arrow). This is a classic pattern for bifascicular block. Contrast this to the other pattern of bifascicular block which would present with a right bundle branch block and right axis deviation (upward QRS in lead II and downward in lead I), which was not seen in this case.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atrial fibrillation may occur secondary to aging, hypertension, or ischemia and presents with an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with an absence of P waves. It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection. It presents on ECG with QRS complexes that twist in amplitude around the electrical baseline. Treatment involves the administration of magnesium sulfate and, if needed, electrical cardioversion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA bifascicular block can progress to complete heart block.",

He lost consciousness for about 30 seconds. When he woke up, he was mildly confused but able to ski down the rest of the mountain. The patient initially denied medical treatment but his wife convinced him to be taken by ambulance to the emergency department for evaluation. The paramedics report that at the scene the patient had a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. During the ride, he became gradually more somnolent. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and a prior transient ischemic attack. His medications include atorvastatin and lisinopril. In the emergency department, his temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 141/84 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 16/min. He is difficult to arouse with a GCS of 7.

        "reason": "This patient presents with a lucid interval followed by worsening somnolence and a biconvex lesion on head CT, which suggests a diagnosis of acute epidural hematoma. Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma. They discuss how patients often sustain these injuries from extreme sports. They recommend being aware of this syndrome so that acute interventions can be taken.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a biconvex hyperdensity that is limited by suture lines (red circle). This is the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma on head CT.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins results in a subdural hematoma (SDH). An acute SDH more commonly presents with a gradual increase in headache and confusion rather than the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome presented in this vignette. However, a minority of patients with acute SDH may have a lucid interval followed by progressive neurological decline. SDH would have a crescent-shaped appearance on head CT rather than the biconvex appearance of an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries describes a lacunar stroke. Although this patient has 2 risk factors for lacunar stroke (hypertension and smoking), this patient\u2019s head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer D: A ruptured cerebral aneurysm would most likely lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap headache\u201d), confusion or somnolence, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Surgical clipping or embolization of the bleeding vessel may be required.\n\nAnswer E: Secondary hemorrhage into a prior area of infarction usually occurs in the setting of a recent embolic stroke. Although this patient has a history of TIA and other risk factors for stroke, his head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma. Treatment is supportive with the control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nBullet Summary:\nEpidural hematomas are caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery as it passes through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone.",

His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 67/43 mmHg, pulse is 135/min, and respirations are 34/min. On physical exam, the patient has upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, and a single transverse palmar crease. His abdomen is non-tender, firm, and distended. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Digital rectal exam evacuates a small amount of stool and flatulence. A nasogastric tube is placed to decompress the stomach. The patient\u2019s abdominal radiograph can be seen in Figure A.

        "reason": "This pediatric patient presents with features of Down syndrome (trisomy 21), bilious vomiting, and colonic distention on an abdominal radiograph, which suggests a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nHirschsprung disease is associated with Down syndrome and presents with bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium in the first 48 hours of life, and abdominal distension. A digital rectal exam may temporarily relieve the obstruction and lead to the expulsion of gas and stool (the \u201csquirt sign\u201d). Abdominal radiography typically demonstrates signs of distal intestinal obstruction such as proximal dilation and an absence of air in the rectum. Contrast enema may reveal a transition zone between the dilated proximal megacolon and the narrow rectosigmoid colon. A biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with surgical removal of the defective segment of the bowel.\n\nKessman reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Hirschsprung disease. She discusses how the diagnosis can be made using a rectal suction biopsy. She recommends monitoring patients closely for enterocolitis for years after surgical treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an abdominal radiograph that demonstrates colonic distension (red circle). This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Duodenal atresia is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and may also present in the first 48 hours of life with bilious vomiting. The abdominal radiograph will demonstrate the \u201cdouble bubble\u201d sign, which reflects air trapping in the stomach and first portion of the duodenum. Treatment is with the surgical opening of the atretic segment.\n\nAnswer C: Intestinal malrotation may preset with bilious vomiting in a neonate due to the development of a midgut volvulus. An abdominal radiograph may show the extension of the nasogastric tube into an abnormally positioned duodenum and would not show diffuse colonic distension. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the volvulus.\n\nAnswer D: Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and also presents with delayed (> 48 hours) passing of meconium. The distal obstruction in these patients will not be temporarily relieved by a digital rectal exam. Contrast enema will demonstrate microcolon involving the entire large bowel. Treatment is with irrigation and removal of the meconium.\n\nAnswer E: Pyloric stenosis usually presents in the first 3-6 weeks of life with post-prandial, nonbilious, projectile vomiting and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium. This patient is presenting at just 2 days of life and has bilious vomiting. Treatment is with surgical release of the stenosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHirschsprung disease is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and presents with retention of stool that can be relieved by digital disimpaction, bilious vomiting, and colonic distention on abdominal radiography.",

The child was born at 38 weeks of gestation to a 28-year-old G3P3 mother. The mother went into spontaneous labor but the delivery was complicated by a prolonged 2nd stage of labor. A vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery was eventually performed. The child\u2019s Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia in the mother which was well-controlled throughout the pregnancy. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 67/43 mmHg, pulse is 135/min, and respirations are 34/min. On physical exam, she appears to be in mild distress and has a 4x5 cm ecchymotic area of swelling over the bilateral parietal bones. Serial assessments of the child\u2019s head circumference over the next 12 hours show no change in the size of the swelling.

        "reason": "This patient presents following a vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery with an ecchymotic swelling of the scalp that crosses the midline, which suggests a diagnosis of caput succedaneum. Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a preceding viral illness, dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop from 150/85 to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration), an echocardiogram with impaired diastolic filling, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG. This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.",

Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.",

The tachycardia (pulse of 140/min) suggests that rate control is necessary.\n\n**Option Analysis**:\n- **(A) Albuterol and prednisone**: This is more appropriate for a COPD exacerbation, but the primary issue here seems to be heart failure.\n- **(B) Digoxin**: Can be used for heart failure and rate control in atrial fibrillation, but it is not the first-line treatment for acute management.\n- **(C) Diltiazem**: Used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, but it can have negative inotropic effects, which may not be ideal in severe heart failure.\n- **(D) Intubation**: Not immediately necessary as the patient is stable on BiPAP.\n- **(E) Metoprolol**: Effective for rate control in heart failure and atrial fibrillation, and it has a more favorable profile in heart failure patients compared to diltiazem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management is to control the patient's heart rate, which is likely contributing to his symptoms. Given his history of heart failure, **Metoprolol** is the best choice as it will help control the heart rate without the negative inotropic effects seen with diltiazem.\n\n### Answer: (E) Metoprolol",
                "To analyze the question and options, we need to consider the patient's clinical presentation, past medical history, and the findings from the physical exam and initial management.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation:**\n   - The patient is a 66-year-old man with acute shortness of breath, which has worsened to the point of dyspnea at rest.\n   - He has a history of poor exercise tolerance, indicating chronic respiratory or cardiac issues.\n\n2. **Past Medical History:**\n   - Myocardial infarction (7 years ago)\n   - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n   - Heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 22%\n   - Obesity\n   - Diabetes\n   - Peripheral vascular disease\n\n3. **Vital Signs:**\n   - Temperature: 97.7\u00b0F (36.5\u00b0C)\n   - Blood pressure: 124/82 mmHg\n   - Pulse: 140/min (tachycardia)\n   - Respirations: 32/min (tachypnea)\n   - Oxygen saturation: 78% on room air (severe hypoxemia)\n\n4. **Physical Exam:**\n   - The patient appears uncomfortable with increased work of breathing.\n   - Bilateral crackles and wheezing are noted on pulmonary exam, suggesting fluid overload and possible bronchospasm.\n\n5. **Initial Management:**\n   - The patient is started on BiPAP, which improves his oxygen saturation to 94%.\n\n6. **Diagnostic Tests:**\n   - ECG and chest radiograph are performed (though not provided here, we can infer typical findings based on the clinical scenario).\n\n### Reasoning for Each Option:\n\n- **(A) Albuterol and prednisone:**\n  - This combination is typically used for COPD exacerbations or asthma. Given the patient's history of COPD and wheezing, this could be appropriate, but it does not address the underlying cardiac issues.\n\n- **(B) Digoxin:**\n  - Digoxin is used for heart failure and atrial fibrillation. However, it is not typically used for acute management of heart failure exacerbations or acute respiratory distress.\n\n- **(C) Diltiazem:**\n  - Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker used for rate control in atrial fibrillation or other tachyarrhythmias. Given the patient's tachycardia, this could be considered, but it does not address the acute respiratory distress.\n\n- **(D) Intubation:**\n  - Intubation is considered for patients who are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation despite non-invasive measures. The patient\u2019s oxygen saturation improved with BiPAP, suggesting that intubation may not be immediately necessary.\n\n- **(E) Metoprolol:**\n  - Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used for rate control in tachyarrhythmias and for heart failure management. However, in the acute setting, especially with severe heart failure and potential COPD exacerbation, beta-blockers can worsen bronchospasm and are not typically first-line.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the patient's history of heart failure with a low ejection fraction, the presence of bilateral crackles, and the improvement with BiPAP, the most appropriate next step would be to address both the cardiac and respiratory components. Albuterol and prednisone would help manage the COPD exacerbation and wheezing, which is likely contributing to his acute respiratory distress.\n\n### Answer:\n(A) Albuterol and prednisone",

The patient has a history of severe heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 22%, which indicates significant systolic dysfunction. The tachycardia (pulse of 140/min) needs to be managed carefully to avoid further decompensation of heart failure. \n\n**Heart Failure Management:**\n- **Metoprolol**: This beta-blocker is effective for rate control in heart failure patients and is preferred due to its benefits in reducing mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients. However, initiating or increasing beta-blockers in the setting of acute decompensated heart failure can be risky due to potential negative inotropic effects.\n- **Digoxin**: This can be used for rate control in heart failure patients, especially when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. It has a positive inotropic effect, which can be beneficial in heart failure.\n\n**COPD Management:**\n- **Albuterol and prednisone**: These are standard treatments for COPD exacerbations. Albuterol is a bronchodilator that can help relieve bronchospasm, and prednisone is a corticosteroid that can reduce inflammation. However, systemic corticosteroids can exacerbate fluid retention and worsen heart failure.\n\n**Respiratory Support:**\n- **BiPAP**: The patient has already been started on BiPAP, which has improved his oxygen saturation. This is an appropriate initial step for managing acute respiratory distress.\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n- **Intubation**: This is considered if the patient fails non-invasive ventilation or if there is a need for airway protection. Given the improvement with BiPAP, intubation is not immediately necessary.\n- **Diltiazem**: This calcium channel blocker is not typically used in heart failure patients due to its negative inotropic effects and potential to worsen heart failure.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\nConsidering the patient's acute presentation with both heart failure and COPD exacerbation, the immediate focus should be on stabilizing the patient while addressing both conditions.

The most appropriate initial treatment is symptomatic relief with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nReduced estrogen levels after menopause lead to vulvovaginal atrophy by causing reduced blood flow and collagen content in vulvovaginal tissues. Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues. Finally, hormone replacement therapy is indicated if symptoms are refractory to all other modalities.\n\nBhupathiraju et al. studied the association between vaginal estrogen and chronic disease risk. The authors found no association between low-dose vaginal estrogen and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and hip fractures over an 18-year period. The authors recommended that low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used indefinitely without concomitant progestin therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole is the treatment for trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis. While patients with trichomoniasis can present with cervical petechiae and punctate hemorrhages, they typically also have frothy green discharge (absent in this patient). While patients with bacterial vaginosis can also have vaginal discharge, the discharge is typically malodorous and symptoms of pruritis are generally absent.\n\nAnswer B: Nitrofurantoin is the treatment of choice for urinary tract infections. While this patient has increased urinary frequency and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, her normal urinalysis makes the diagnosis of urinary tract infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer C: Topical clobetasol cream is the treatment for lichen sclerosis. While lichen sclerosis can present with pain with intercourse and vulvar pruritis, patients often have plaques that disrupt the normal vulvar architecture. Lichen sclerosis does not affect the vaginal tissues.\n\nAnswer D: Topical estrogen is the treatment of choice for cases of vulvovaginal atrophy resistant to treatment with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. This patient should first be trialed on vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nBullet Summary:\nVulvovaginal atrophy is initially treated with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.",

Her past medical history is unremarkable and she is not currently taking any medications. She denies drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, or using recreational drugs. She attributes her palpitations to recently drinking more caffeine, but would like to obtain an electrocardiogram since her symptoms are worrisome and affecting her ability to concentrate on her career as a fitness instructor. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), blood pressure is 116/76 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

        },
        "answer_idx": "B",
        "reason": "This patient's progressively increasing PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex on ECG is consistent with second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz type I, also referred to as Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nSecond degree AV block, Mobitz type I can occur in a variety of settings, such as in the context of digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or increased vagal tone. On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension. The treatment is pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSecond degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I, is characterized by progressively lengthening PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex.",

Unlikely given the patient's stable vitals and lack of severe symptoms.\n\n**Step 4: Correlation with Lifestyle and Symptoms**\n- The patient is a fitness instructor, which often correlates with a lower resting heart rate due to increased vagal tone and cardiovascular efficiency.\n- The intermittent palpitations could be related to increased caffeine intake, which is a common and benign cause of such symptoms in otherwise healthy individuals.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\n**D. Sinus Bradycardia**\n\n**Rationale**: Given the patient's profession as a fitness instructor, her low resting heart rate (55/min) is likely a result of increased cardiovascular efficiency and vagal tone, which is common in physically active individuals. The absence of more complex arrhythmias or blocks on the ECG, combined with her overall good health and lack of severe symptoms, supports the diagnosis of sinus bradycardia.

        "final_raw_response": "Based on the provided information and the insights from the medical experts, the most likely diagnosis for the 24-year-old woman is sinus bradycardia. Here is the detailed rationale:\n\n1. **Patient's Background and Symptoms**: The patient is a 24-year-old fitness instructor, which suggests a high level of physical fitness. It is well-documented that athletes and individuals with high physical fitness often have lower resting heart rates due to increased vagal tone and efficient cardiac function. The patient's heart rate of 55/min, while lower than the average, is not uncommon for someone with her fitness level.\n\n2. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient reports intermittent palpitations but does not have any severe symptoms such as dizziness, syncope, or chest pain. This further supports a benign condition rather than a more serious cardiac issue.\n\n3. **ECG Findings**: The ECG findings described include a regular rhythm with a heart rate of 55/min, normal P waves, PR intervals, and QRS complexes. These findings are consistent with sinus bradycardia. There is no mention of irregular rhythms, dropped beats, or prolonged PR intervals that would suggest any form of atrioventricular block.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses**:\n   - **First Degree Atrioventricular Block (A)**: This condition would present with a prolonged PR interval (>200 ms), which is not mentioned in the patient's ECG findings.\n   - **Second Degree Atrioventricular Block, Mobitz Type I (B)**: This condition would show progressively lengthening PR intervals until a beat is dropped, which is not described in the ECG.\n   - **Second Degree Atrioventricular Block, Mobitz Type II (C)**: This condition would show sudden dropped beats without a change in PR interval, which is not consistent with the regular rhythm described.\n   - **Third Degree Atrioventricular Block (E)**: This condition would present with complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity, which is not indicated in the ECG findings.\n\nGiven the patient's fitness level, the absence of severe symptoms, and the ECG findings, the most appropriate diagnosis is sinus bradycardia.\n\n**Final Answer: D**",

In general, he has been in good health; however, he recently has experienced weight loss, abdominal pain, and general fatigue. He has a medical history of anxiety, diabetes, a fracture of his foot sustained when he tripped, and a recent cold that caused him to miss work for 1 week. His current medications include metformin, insulin, buspirone, vitamin D, calcium, and sodium docusate. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 150/100 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with leukocytosis and an elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase suggestive of a leukemoid reaction.\n\nA leukemoid reaction typically presents with a drastically elevated leukocyte count (typically > 50,000/mm^3) in the setting of an elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score (LAP). This reaction typically occurs after a major infection and is an immunologic response to the pathogen that caused the illness. In contrast, chronic myeloid leukemia presents with a similar elevation in leukocytes but a low LAP score in addition to symptoms of general malaise, fatigue, and weight loss. The LAP score is the critical differentiating factor when comparing these 2 pathologies. Treatment for a leukemoid reaction is by addressing the underlying pathology.\n\nPortich and Faulhaber review the evidence regarding the diagnosis of leukemoid reaction. They discuss how the most common cause is infection. They recommend considering paraneoplastic syndromes in patients without evidence of infection.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma presents in a pediatric patient with pallor, fatigue, easy bruising, fever, bone pain, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Treatment is with combination chemotherapy.\n\nAnswer B: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia can present similarly to a leukemoid reaction with non-specific systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy but is a less likely diagnosis in this patient given his age and LAP score. Treatment is with ibrutinib and rituximab as well as other agents.\n\nAnswer C: Chronic myeloid leukemia presents with systemic symptoms, fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and abdominal pain with an elevated leukocyte count (typically > 50,000/mm^3) but a depressed LAP score. Treatment is with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n\nAnswer E: Multiple myeloma presents with systemic symptoms, weight loss, pathologic fractures, and hypercalcemia. It is not associated with an elevated leukocyte score and an elevated LAP score.

The patient's history of good health, aside from these recent symptoms, aligns with the typical presentation of CML, which often develops insidiously.\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - **Leukocyte Count**: The patient has a significantly elevated leukocyte count of 66,500/mm^3. This level of leukocytosis is highly suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder, such as CML.\n   - **Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase (LAP)**: The elevated LAP score is consistent with CML. In CML, the LAP score can be variable, but it is often elevated in the chronic phase.\n   - **Other Blood Counts**: The hemoglobin and hematocrit are slightly low, which can be seen in CML due to the replacement of normal hematopoietic cells by leukemic cells.

        "reason": "This patient\u2019s new-onset palpitations, irregularly irregular pulse, and absent p-waves on ECG are consistent with atrial fibrillation. In hemodynamically stable patients with a relative contraindication to \u03b2-blockers (COPD on home oxygen with increasing oxygen need), rate control with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil is preferred.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. ECG findings will be an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves with an erratic baseline as shown in Illustration A. Treatment is centered on rate control. First-line agents for rate control include \u03b21 selective blockers (metoprolol and esmolol) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem). In patients with COPD, non-selective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, timolol, and sotalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction by activating \u03b22-adrenoreceptors. Other relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers include Raynaud disease and depression (increased risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction). In patients with relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred initial treatment option.\n\nVan Gelder et al. studied lenient (resting heart rate < 110 beats per minute) versus strict rate control (resting heart rate < 80 beats per minute) in patients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized control trial. The authors found that there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmias between the 2 groups. The authors recommend a lenient rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG lacking P waves (red arrows) and irregularly irregular RR intervals (red/blue lines), which are classic findings in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic that can be used in patients to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is often suitable to use in patients with depressed left ventricular function. Amiodarone has multiple multi-system adverse effects including pulmonary toxicity, and it is not used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer B: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Although patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, the preferred anticoagulation agents are warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban).\n\nAnswer C: Digoxin can be used as a rate control agent in atrial fibrillation as it directly suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of toxicity, it is used as second-line therapy when first-line agents fail.\n\nAnswer D: Metoprolol is a \u03b2-blocker that is a first-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice. This patient has COPD with increasing oxygen needs making calcium channel blockers possibly a better choice.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation and relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden onset confusion, slurred speech, asymmetric smile, and weakness in the setting of risk factors for stroke (atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and hypertension). The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

        "reason": "This patient with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, deviation of the tongue to the right, left-sided hemiparesis, and decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the left side of his body most likely has a stroke of the right medial medulla. The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome). This leads to lesions to the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Clinically this presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased gag reflex, vomiting, vertigo, decreased pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which presents with ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities, and contralateral loss of light touch and vibration sensation.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with chest pain and an ECG demonstrating hyperacute T waves (leads V2-V6) which is an early finding concerning for a myocardial infarction.\n\nA myocardial infarction occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures causing occlusion of a coronary artery. Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI. The authors note that T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression can before, during, or after the STEMI event. The authors recommend obtaining serial ECGs in patients with suspected STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates hyperacute T waves (blue arrows) that are only occurring in a vascular distribution (V2-V6).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia can present with peaked T waves; however, peaked T waves would be demonstrated in all leads. Other findings of hyperkalemia can include QRS widening. Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias. Repletion with potassium is the preferred treatment, and the magnesium level should be checked as low magnesium can lead to potassium wasting in the kidneys.\n\nAnswer E: Pericarditis presents with chest pain worse by laying back and relieved by leaning forward. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions, and echocardiography may demonstrate a pericardial effusion. Management involves the administration of ibuprofen or colchicine and steroids in refractory cases. However, these therapies should not be used after myocardial infarction.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHyperacute T waves are an early finding that is concerning for myocardial infarction.",

Here is a detailed rationale for this conclusion:\n\n1. **Positional Chest Pain**: The patient's chest pain worsens when leaning back and improves when leaning forward, which is a classic feature of pericarditis. This positional nature of the pain is less commonly associated with other conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI), hyperkalemia, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), or hypokalemia.\n\n2. **ECG Findings**: The description of the ECG findings, which include diffuse ST elevation and PR depression, is highly indicative of pericarditis. These ECG changes are not typical for hyperkalemia, HOCM, hypokalemia, or MI. In MI, ST elevation is usually localized to specific leads corresponding to the affected coronary artery territory, rather than being diffuse.\n\n3. **Associated Symptoms**: The patient also reports shortness of breath and syncope. While these symptoms can be seen in other conditions, when combined with the positional chest pain and specific ECG findings, they further support the diagnosis of pericarditis.\n\n4. **Systematic Exclusion of Other Diagnoses**:\n   - **Hyperkalemia**: Typically presents with peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and can progress to sine wave patterns on ECG, which are not described here.\n   - **HOCM**: Usually presents with a systolic murmur that increases with Valsalva maneuver and may show left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG, which is not indicated in this case.\n   - **Hypokalemia**: Often presents with U waves, flattened T waves, and ST depression on ECG, which are not described here.\n   - **Myocardial Infarction**: Typically presents with localized ST elevation in specific leads, corresponding to the area of infarction, rather than diffuse ST elevation.\n\nGiven the patient's clinical presentation, ECG findings, and the exclusion of other differential diagnoses, the most likely diagnosis is pericarditis.\n\n**Final Answer: E (Pericarditis)**",

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for this disease.\n\nOral leukoplakia presents with a white patch/plaque that occurs over the oral mucosa that is adherent and non-scrapable. Risk factors for this condition include the risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma such as consumption of alcohol and smoking. Though the cause of this lesion is largely idiopathic, any irritating substance can induce it. Other potential risk factors include candidiasis, vitamin deficiency, endocrine disturbances, and viral infections. A diagnosis can be made using a biopsy showing the degree of dysplasia. Treatment is with smoking and alcohol cessation as well as surgical removal for suspicious lesions.\n\nMohammed and Fairozekhan review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and risk factors for leukoplakia. They discuss how this disease is associated with smoking and alcohol use. They recommend screening patients for these modifiable risk factors.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating adherent white plaques on the inside of the cheek (red circle). These findings are consistent with oral leukoplakia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Antibiotic use is a risk factor for candidiasis; however, this patient is not presenting with symptoms of candidiasis which is itself a risk factor for oral leukoplakia. Candidiasis presents with opaque white lesions that can be scraped off.\n\nAnswer C: Intravenous drug use does make this patient riskier overall for many conditions; however, alcohol is a more direct risk factor for oral leukoplakia. Immunodeficiency conditions can cause widespread fungal and viral infections on the mucosal surfaces.\n\nAnswer D: Poor dental hygiene may be found more often in patients with oral leukoplakia; however, it is not itself a direct cause.\n\nAnswer E: Sexual intercourse would predispose this patient to infections and viruses (such as Epstein-Barr virus); however, it is a less likely risk factor than is alcohol consumption or smoking.

This background suggests potential mental health challenges, which can sometimes correlate with substance use disorders, including intravenous drug use.\n\n2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The physical exam is notable for a specific finding, which, although not explicitly described in the question, is implied to be significant. Both the Innovative Medical Thinker and the Critical Medical Analyst emphasize physical signs such as track marks or skin infections, which are strongly associated with intravenous drug use.\n\n3. **Temperature and Symptoms**: The patient's slightly elevated temperature (99.5\u00b0F) could indicate an infection, which is a common complication of intravenous drug use due to the introduction of pathogens through non-sterile injection practices.\n\n4. **Expert Consensus**: Both the Innovative Medical Thinker and the Critical Medical Analyst conclude that intravenous drug use is the most likely risk factor, given the patient's profile and the physical findings. The Clinical Decision Specialist suggests poor dental hygiene, but this does not align as closely with the physical signs typically associated with intravenous drug use.\n\n5. **Observable Signs**: Intravenous drug use is known to present with observable signs such as track marks, skin infections, and possibly abscesses, which are more specific and identifiable during a physical examination compared to the signs of poor dental hygiene.\n\nTherefore, considering the patient's history, the physical findings, and the expert analyses, the most likely risk factor for the patient's presenting condition is:\n\n**Final Answer: C (Intravenous drug use)**",

Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose.

It presents as acute onset, painless vision loss, normally in one eye. On fundoscopic exam, classic findings of this disease include venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool exudates, and edema/swelling of the optic disk can be seen. There is no definitive treatment for this disorder but symptomatic treatment includes intravitreal glucocorticoid injections and retinal laser photocoagulation. Retinal vein occlusion may resolve spontaneously or progress to permanent vision loss.\n\nRobinson and Halpern present evidence regarding the treatment of retinal vein occlusion.

Minor cases where the patient is cognitively intact can be treated with oral replacement with an electrolyte balanced solution (though this would be heat exhaustion and not heat stroke). Patients with altered mental status should be started on normal saline or lactated ringer, and sodium levels should be corrected slowly. Rapid correction of serum sodium or administration of hypotonic fluids can cause cerebral edema and seizures; however, this is more common in hypernatremia that has persisted for days as it has led to cerebral adaptations.\n\nTinawi reviewed the evidence regarding the use of intravenous fluids in the hospital setting.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction (slurred speech and right upper extremity weakness) that has completely resolved, which is concerning for a transient ischemic attack. In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin. It can more accurately characterize if a stroke occurred, and the extent of the injury.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe workup of a transient ischemic attack should be centered on a thorough neurological exam, a non-contrast CT scan of the head, and administration of aspirin assuming there is no intracranial bleed.",

Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data. The authors found that sickle cell trait is associated with increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy. The authors recommend further evaluation of these associations using prospective studies derived from clinical data.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows gel electrophoresis with an example of a normal (95-98% HbA and < 2% HbF), sickle cell trait (50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF), and sickle cell anemia (85-95% HbS and 5-15% HbF) patient from left to right.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diabetes has not been associated with sickle cell trait in the majority of studies.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is a complication of sickle cell anemia. Mechanisms include functional asplenism, reduced tissue perfusion during a sickle crisis, and chronic transfusions with an indwelling catheter. Common infections include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitis. Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism. Most individuals with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic by age 2 to 4. The spleen subsequently cannot phagocytose encapsulated organisms properly, which predisposes sickle cell patients to infection.\n\nAnswer E: Stroke is a complication of sickle cell anemia but not sickle cell trait. This is due to the increased viscosity of the blood and reduced deformability of red cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSickle cell trait is associated with episodes of painless hematuria.",

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient is presenting with constant vertigo, ataxia, vomiting, and a head impulse test revealing a corrective saccade, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) exam, which suggests a peripheral etiology of vertigo, most likely vestibular neuritis. As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient\u2019s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.",

                "### Updated Thinking\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of constant dizziness, ataxic gait, rightward nystagmus, and the lack of change with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the symptoms strongly suggest a central cause of vertigo. The head impulse test revealing a corrective saccade further supports a central etiology. Both the Innovative Medical Thinker and Clinical Decision Specialist have emphasized the importance of imaging, particularly MRI, in evaluating potential central nervous system issues such as stroke.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Symptoms and Physical Examination**:\n   - Constant dizziness and sensation of the room spinning.\n   - Ataxic gait and rightward nystagmus.\n   - No change with Dix-Hallpike maneuver.\n   - Corrective saccade on head impulse test.\n   - No skew deviation.\n\n2. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - Central causes of vertigo (e.g., stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor).\n   - Peripheral causes are less likely given the constant nature of dizziness and lack of response to positional testing.\n\n3. **Imaging Modality**:\n   - MRI brain is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting central neurological issues, including stroke.\n   - CT head is less sensitive for detecting acute ischemic strokes, especially in the posterior fossa.\n\n4. **Other Options**:\n   - Epley maneuver is used for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is less likely given the constant dizziness and lack of response to Dix-Hallpike maneuver.\n   - Prednisone is not indicated without a clear diagnosis of an inflammatory condition.\n   - Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used for acute ischemic stroke but requires confirmation of the diagnosis and assessment of eligibility criteria.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\n**C) MRI brain**\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to obtain an MRI brain. This imaging modality is the most sensitive for detecting central neurological issues such as stroke, which is highly suspected given the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The MRI will help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.",
                "### Updated Thinking\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 33-year-old man with constant dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, and rightward nystagmus. His symptoms are not relieved by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which suggests a central rather than peripheral cause of vertigo.\n\n2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of ataxia and nystagmus, along with a corrective saccade on the head impulse test, further supports a central cause. The absence of skew deviation does not rule out a central cause.\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given the symptoms and examination findings, the differential diagnosis includes central nervous system pathologies such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or a brain tumor. Peripheral causes like benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are less likely due to the constant nature of the dizziness and lack of response to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.\n\n4. **Imaging Considerations**: \n   - **CT Head**: While a CT scan can quickly identify acute hemorrhage, it is less sensitive for detecting posterior fossa lesions and other subtle central nervous system abnormalities.\n   - **MRI Brain**: MRI is more sensitive for detecting posterior fossa lesions, demyelinating diseases, and other central nervous system pathologies. Given the clinical suspicion of a central cause, MRI is the preferred imaging modality.\n\n5. **Other Options**:\n   - **Epley Maneuver**: This is used for treating BPPV, which has been ruled out based on the clinical presentation.\n   - **Prednisone**: This is not indicated without a clear diagnosis that would benefit from steroid treatment.\n   - **Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA)**: This is used for acute ischemic stroke within a specific time window. While stroke is a consideration, imaging is needed first to confirm the diagnosis before administering tPA.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\n**C) MRI brain**\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe patient's symptoms and examination findings strongly suggest a central cause of vertigo. The constant dizziness, ataxia, and nystagmus, along with the lack of response to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, point towards a central nervous system pathology. An MRI brain is the most appropriate next step as it is more sensitive for detecting posterior fossa lesions and other central nervous system abnormalities. This imaging modality will help in accurately diagnosing the underlying cause and guiding further management."

These findings suggest a central cause of vertigo rather than a peripheral one. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which is typically used to diagnose benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), did not change the patient's symptoms, further supporting a central etiology.\n\nGiven the concern for a central nervous system pathology, such as a stroke or other lesion in the posterior fossa, the most appropriate next step in management is to obtain imaging that can accurately identify these potential issues. An MRI brain is the preferred imaging modality in this scenario because it is more sensitive than a CT head for detecting posterior fossa lesions and other central nervous system abnormalities.\n\nThe other options are less appropriate in this context:\n- (A) CT head: While a CT scan can be useful in some cases, it is less sensitive than MRI for detecting posterior fossa lesions.\n- (B) Epley maneuver: This is a treatment for BPPV, which is not supported by the patient's presentation and examination findings.\n- (D) Prednisone: This is not indicated without a clear diagnosis that would benefit from steroid treatment.\n- (E) Tissue plasminogen activator: This is used for acute ischemic stroke, but further imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis before considering this treatment.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an MRI brain to evaluate for central nervous system pathologies.\n\nFinal answer: (C) MRI brain",

        "reason": "This patient with confusion, dark urine, and peaked T waves on electrocardiogram in the setting of a prolonged time spent down likely has developed rhabdomyolysis with associated hyperkalemia. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

MEN2B is also associated with pheochromocytomas, which cause elevated plasma metanephrines.\n\nMEN2B is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the RET proto-oncogene and presents with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma, Marfanoid habitus, and mucosal neuromas. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs in almost all patients with MEN2B and is often metastatic at the time of diagnosis. Patients should be screened for pheochromocytoma using plasma fractionated metanephrines at the time of diagnosis of MTC. Intestinal neuromas may also lead to intestinal manifestations such as chronic constipation and megacolon. Treatment is with surgical excision of malignant lesions and active screening for future development of tumors.\n\nCastinetti et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of MEN2B. They discuss how often the first presentation of this disease involves the diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma. They recommend developing techniques for earlier diagnosis of this disease in order to allow for better survival.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating mucosal neuromas, which are painless nodules on the lips or tongue (red circles). These findings are characteristically seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: An elevated serum calcium level would suggest parathyroid hyperplasia, which is a feature of both type 1 and type 2A multiple endocrine neoplasia. Rather than hypercalcemia, this patient is likely to have an elevated serum calcitonin level due to his medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nAnswer C: An elevated serum prolactin level would suggest the presence of a prolactinoma, which is a pituitary tumor that may be seen in type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1). Other findings in this disorder include parathyroid and pancreatic tumors. Treatment is with surgical excision of malignant lesions.\n\nAnswer D: Fasting hypoglycemia would suggest the presence of an insulinoma, which is a less common pancreatic tumor that may be seen in MEN1. Other findings in this disorder include parathyroid and pancreatic tumors. Patients with an insulinoma require surgical excision in order to allow for proper glucose homeostasis.\n\nAnswer E: A positive fecal occult blood test would raise suspicion for colorectal cancer, which is a feature of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). The extraintestinal manifestations of PJS include mucocutaneous pigmented macules on the lips and perioral region.

The most appropriate next step in management is to start an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as lisinopril.\n\nWhen a patient experiences a myocardial infarction, there are certain medications that the patient should be started on that lower mortality. These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction. They discuss how an ACE inhibitor is the standard of care in patients currently. They recommend performing a randomized controlled trial comparing these treatment modalities.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an ECG with ST elevation (red circles) in leads II, III, and AVF. These ST elevations are indicative of a STEMI.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hydrochlorothiazide can be used to manage this patient's blood pressure; however, this drug does not lower mortality like an ACE inhibitor. In the setting of patients with myocardial infarctions, inhibition of detrimental ventricular remodeling is key for lowering mortality.\n\nAnswer C: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to reduce blood pressure; however, it does not reduce mortality in patients who have experienced an MI. Calcium channel blockers tend to have few side effects and can be safely started in most patients.\n\nAnswer D: Continuing current medications and scheduling a follow-up appointment misses the opportunity for the patient to be started on a mortality-lowering ACE inhibitor. In patients who are amenable to starting a new medication, an ACE inhibitor should be administered to all patients who have sustained an MI.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to carvedilol would be unnecessary and not likely to benefit this patient as much as adding an ACE inhibitor.

She feels more irritable with her husband and children and does not find pleasure in creating art anymore. Over the last 2 weeks, she has been sleeping approximately 5 hours a night and had a fall while walking in her home with the lights off. She denies any head trauma or loss of consciousness associated with the fall. She has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and hypothyroidism for which she takes escitalopram and levothyroxine. She had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 5 years ago. She has been in a monogamous relationship with her husband for the last 15 years and uses a copper intrauterine device. Physical examination is notable for a depressed affect. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. She has 4/5 strength in the bilateral lower extremities and brisk patellar reflexes. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?",

            "E": "Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose"
        },
        "answer_idx": "D",
        "reason": "This patient's mood changes and findings concerning for subacute combined degeneration (fall in the dark, impaired proprioception, weakness, and brisk patellar reflexes), and history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery are concerning for vitamin B12 deficiency. Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased. It would not present with the abnormal neurologic findings seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRoux-en-Y bariatric surgery increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency via reduction of food intake, decreased functional parietal cell count, and reduced absorption of vitamin B12 (which may cause subacute combined degeneration).",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a pattern of chest pain (pressure and diaphoresis) that is highly concerning for an acute myocardial infarction. This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome. They recommend aspirin and catheterization in an acute STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an initial ECG with ST depression (blue arrows) followed by pseudonormalization of the ST segment (green arrows) and possibly hyperacute T waves (black arrows), which are concerning for ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac catheterization may be required in this patient; however, if the patient\u2019s chest pain improves or if the troponin is negative, it is unlikely he is having an acute myocardial infarction requiring immediate catheterization. Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.",

The patient's vital signs and physical exam findings further support the urgency of the situation. The ECG findings, although not provided in detail, are implied to show changes consistent with myocardial ischemia or infarction, given the context of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient presents with classic symptoms of ACS, including chest pressure and diaphoresis, which started during physical exertion.\n2. **Risk Factors**: The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, including diabetes, obesity, and a significant smoking history.\n3. **Vital Signs and Physical Exam**: The patient is hypertensive, tachycardic, and diaphoretic, which are concerning signs in the context of chest pain.\n4. **Initial Management**: The patient has been given aspirin and nitroglycerin, with minimal improvement in symptoms.\n5. **ECG Findings**: Although the specific ECG findings are not detailed, the worsening of chest pain and the need for a repeat ECG suggest dynamic changes indicative of myocardial ischemia or infarction.\n6. **Troponin Level**: A troponin level has been drawn, but the results are not yet available. Elevated troponin would confirm myocardial injury, but waiting for the result is not advisable given the clinical urgency.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\nGiven the high likelihood of an acute coronary event and the patient's worsening symptoms despite initial treatment, the most appropriate next step is to proceed with **cardiac catheterization**.

He feels guilty for not spending more time with his wife before she died. He was recently fired for making several major bookkeeping mistakes at work as an accountant as he had trouble focusing. The patient is requesting oxycodone at this appointment as he states he has burning pain in his legs that feels worse now than it has in years past. The patient has a past medical history of obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sleep changes, interest loss, guilt, decrease in energy, and trouble concentrating for greater than 2 weeks concerning for major depressive disorder. In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent. However, it is highly effective in patients who have failed other first-line agents and should still be used in appropriate candidates.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSNRIs are appropriate first-line agents for major depressive disorder in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

Physical exam reveals a confused man who is moving all 4 extremities and is protecting his airway. During the exam, he develops a tonic-clonic seizure, which lasts 1 minute and then terminates on its own. The patient is given intravenous fluids, and basic laboratory studies are drawn and pending. A urine dipstick is positive for red blood cells. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on laboratory testing?",

        "answer_idx": "D",
        "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).",

A glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells.\n\nA glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas. This tumor pathologically secretes glucagon leading to profound hyperglycemia that is refractory to the normal treatments for diabetes. Patients also present with a classic rash termed necrolytic migratory erythema which presents with painful, erythematous papules and plaques. Other findings include gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hematologic findings include a normocytic, normochromic anemia. The diagnosis can be supported with a glucagon level, which will be elevated. Imaging of the pancreas by CT or MRI (more accurate) can further support the diagnosis.\n\nZandee et al. review glucagonoma. They note the presentation and symptoms associated with a glucagonoma, including the classic rash and elevated blood glucose. They recommend considering this diagnosis in patients who present with rash and hyperglycemia refractory to typical treatments.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Beta-cell destruction is the pathophysiology of type I diabetes mellitus which presents with polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, and hyperglycemia (typically in a pediatric patient). It can progress to diabetic ketoacidosis which presents with hyperglycemia, an anion gap acidosis, altered mental status, and Kussmaul respirations.\n\nAnswer C: Beta-cell tumor describes an insulinoma, which would present with hypoglycemia refractory to glucose administration. This condition is caused by increased release of insulin. The diagnosis should be suspected in the setting of hypoglycemia, an elevated insulin level, and an elevated C-peptide level. Imaging of the abdomen/pancreas with an MRI will reveal the insulin-secreting mass.\n\nAnswer D: Hypercortisolism can cause Cushing syndrome which presents with hyperglycemia, obesity, striae, limb/muscle atrophy, mood changes, and hypertension. A buffalo hump and moon faces may also be seen. This condition can either be from endogenous ACTH production or cortisol production or can be from exogenous steroid use.\n\nAnswer E: Insulin resistance is the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and presents with obesity, hyperglycemia, and an elevated hemoglobin A1c. The mainstay of management is weight loss, though medications such as metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin are often needed.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas that hypersecretes glucagon.",

He has a history of obesity and smoking. His vital signs are relatively stable, but his blood glucose is extremely high (>500 mg/dL).\n\n2. **Symptoms Analysis**:\n   - **Fatigue and Malaise**: Common in many systemic conditions, including metabolic disorders.\n   - **Painful Rash**: Erythematous rash with papules and plaques on the face, torso, and extremities. This could be indicative of a dermatological manifestation of a systemic condition.\n   - **Abdominal Pain and Diarrhea**: These symptoms can be associated with metabolic disturbances or infections.\n   - **High Blood Glucose**: A reading of >500 mg/dL indicates severe hyperglycemia, which is a critical clue.\n\n3. **Medical History**: Obesity and smoking are risk factors for several metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Alpha Cell Tumor**: Typically associated with glucagonoma, which can cause hyperglycemia but is less common and usually presents with necrolytic migratory erythema, which is a specific type of rash.\n   - **Beta Cell Destruction**: Seen in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. However, the patient's age and obesity make Type 1 less likely.\n   - **Beta Cell Tumor**: Insulinoma, which typically causes hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia.\n   - **Hypercortisolism**: Cushing's syndrome can cause hyperglycemia, but the rash described is not typical for Cushing's.\n   - **Insulin Resistance**: Common in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, especially in the context of obesity and smoking. Severe hyperglycemia and the described rash (potentially acanthosis nigricans) are consistent with this.\n\n5. **Most Likely Diagnosis**: Given the patient's age, obesity, smoking history, and severe hyperglycemia, the most likely underlying pathophysiology is insulin resistance, which is characteristic of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(E) Insulin resistance"

This combination of symptoms is highly concerning for a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose which can cause an anticholinergic toxidrome and urinary retention.\n\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were once a mainstay in the treatment of depression before the advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). They are sometimes still used for depression and neuropathic pain. In overdose, TCAs block sodium channels in the heart and cause a pathognomonic QRS widening. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered until the QRS duration normalizes. TCAs also have anticholinergic properties and can cause an anticholinergic toxidrome including delirium, confusion, constipation, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, dry, warm, and flushed skin, and fever. Although physostigmine is typically the antidote of choice for an anticholinergic toxidrome, it is avoided in TCA toxicity due to the theoretical concern for inducing a cardiac arrest.\n\nUrquhart et al. studied the utility of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of chronic lower back pain. They found no significant difference in pain reduction compared to placebo. They recommend further study of the potential benefits of TCAs, independent of sleep improvement, for the treatment of lower back pain.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating QRS widening (note how long the red lines are which demarcate the QRS duration) which is highly concerning for TCA overdose.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diaphoresis, tachycardia, increased bowel sounds, and agitation would be seen in a sympathomimetic toxidrome from drugs like cocaine or amphetamines. Rather, dry, flushed skin would be seen in an anticholinergic toxidrome.\n\nAnswer B: Jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain would be seen in acetaminophen overdose which can cause fulminant liver failure. It is also possible that patients may initially be asymptomatic in acetaminophen overdose, and a high level of suspicion must be maintained for this diagnosis. A serum acetaminophen level should be drawn in any patient suspected of overdose.\n\nAnswer C: Miosis, bradypnea, decreased bowel sounds, and somnolence would be seen in an opioid toxidrome. Rather, dilated and minimally responsive pupils would be seen in an anticholinergic toxidrome.\n\nAnswer D: Wheezing, bronchorrhea, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, confusion, and drooling would be seen in a cholinergic toxidrome from agents such as organophosphates or nerve gases like sarin. None of these symptoms are seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA tricyclic antidepressant overdose can cause QRS widening on ECG as well as an anticholinergic toxidrome (dry, flushed skin, constipation, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, and altered mental status).",

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration). This patient is oxygenating well, protecting his airway, and does not have profound bradypnea.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOpioid overdose presents with somnolence, pinpoint pupils, decreased bowel sounds, and bradypnea; stable patients who are adequately breathing and protecting their airway require only observation until clinically sober.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with pain upon defecation, constipation, and a fissure lateral to the midline which is suggestive of an anal fissure. Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures. They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery. They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation. It would be inappropriate to only treat this patient symptomatically with a lateral anal fissure as this is a sign of a more serious diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnal fissures that are lateral to the midline require workup for sexually transmitted infections, cancer, and autoimmune disease.",

        "reason": "This patient with recently diagnosed HIV and tuberculosis infection (upper lung lobe infiltrate) is presenting with worsening symptoms after being appropriately treated. Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections. Corticosteroid use is part of symptom management as it decreases the inflammatory response.\n\nBullet Summary:\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can result in worsening of infectious symptoms and is managed by continuing antiviral therapy with symptomatic treatment.",

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.",

He is admitted to the medical intensive care unit for continuous electroencephalogram monitoring while on a midazolam infusion for seizure suppression and supportive care for his burn. Overnight, the nurse continued to increase the patient's midazolam infusion rate, but she also noticed that his left toes were cold to the touch with significant edema. His temperature is now 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 10/min and oxygen saturation is 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

The most appropriate next step in management is emergent escharotomy to restore blood flow.\n\nBurns can be caused by chemical, thermal, electrical, and radiation sources. The initial inflammation causes vasodilatation and hyperemia, which can progress to edema and local microvascular thrombosis. If not promptly addressed, tissue necrosis and irreversible damage can occur. Circumferential burns can evolve into eschars that constrict blood flow and cause distal compartment syndrome. A delta pressure (diastolic pressure minus local compartment pressure) lower than 30 mmHg is diagnostic. In the case of eschar-induced compartment syndrome, the most appropriate next step is escharotomy to alleviate pressure.\n\nOrmiston and Marappa-Ganeshan review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with compartment syndrome. They discuss how this condition can be caused by many different pathologies including burns. They recommend the emergent release of constrictive structures.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amputation may be necessary if the distal limb is completely necrotic and not salvageable. Timely release of the eschar can allow for reperfusion of the limb and prevent this outcome.\n\nAnswer C: Fasciotomy is the treatment of choice for compartment syndrome not due to a circumferential eschar, but in this case the least invasive surgical intervention should be performed first without releasing all the compartments of the lower leg. If escharotomy does not relieve the compartment syndrome then fasciotomy may be required.\n\nAnswer D: Intravenous fluid infusion based on the Parkland formula is part of comprehensive burn management, but would not address the underlying compartment syndrome, which is more urgent at this time.\n\nAnswer E: Transfer to a specialized burn center can be considered since circumferential burns are one of the admission criteria, but early escharotomy should be performed first.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCircumferential burns that cause eschars and compartment syndrome require an escharotomy.",

The chronic phase presents with < 10% blasts and is often asymptomatic. The accelerated phase has increased blasts, and patients present with fatigue, weight loss, malaise, night sweats, abdominal pain, and hepatosplenomegaly. Finally, the blast phase presents similar to the accelerated phase but with more severe symptoms. The blast phase may evolve into a blast crisis (> 20% blasts) which could cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. Hypervicosity syndrome may require IV fluids and leukapheresis. The most common translocation in CML is the 9;22 translocation which forms the BCR:ABL gene product.\n\nJain et al. review CML. They note the outcomes in patients in the blast phase in CML and how there are more poor outcomes associated with this phase. They recommend paying close attention and obtaining a CBC with a differential to determine the percent blasts.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is more common in pediatric patients and presents with pancytopenia, fatigue, recurrent infections (from leukopenia), and bleeding (from thrombocytopenia). Other findings include systemic symptoms, malaise, fever, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly.\n\nAnswer B: Acute myelogenous leukemia is a malignancy of myeloblasts and presents in the elderly. Patients will present with fatigue, malaise, weight loss, anorexia, fever, leukocytosis, anemia (causing fatigue), thrombocytopenia (causing bleeding), and neutropenia (leading to life-threatening infections). Auer rods can be seen on peripheral smear.\n\nAnswer C: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a monoclonal proliferation of incompetent mature B cells that occurs in elderly men and is the most common form of leukemia in the west. Patients are often asymptomatic and may have a white blood cell count > 50,000/mm^3. When symptomatic, patients may experience chills, weight loss, and weakness (note these symptoms are nonspecific). Peripheral smear will show smudge cells.\n\nAnswer E: Multiple myeloma is common in the elderly and presents with CRAB: hyperCalcemia, Renal insufficiency, Anemia, and lytic Bone lesions/Back pain. The diagnosis is supported with protein electrophoresis and confirmed when biopsy demonstrates increased plasma cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nChronic myelogenous leukemia presents with increased white blood cells which may be >50,000/mm^3 (possibly with elevated blasts).",

The pathophysiology of HA is vascular ectasia from exposure to OCPs and androgens.\n\nA hepatic adenoma typically occurs secondary to exposure to OCPs and androgens (anabolic steroids) causing a generalized vascular ectasia. Both of these drugs should be discontinued in patients with hepatic adenoma. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Sudden worsening of pain with unstable vitals suggests a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Patients should be managed with fluids and an ultrasound should be performed to support the diagnosis. Additional imaging tests include an abdominal contrast-enhanced CT to better characterize the pathologic anatomy in this disease. The definitive treatment in this disease is surgery in order to remove the hepatic adenoma. In cases of a ruptured hepatic adenomas, patients require transfusion and operative management.\n\nBioulac-Sage et al. present the current data that are available for classifying hepatic adenomas. They discuss how many of these lesions involve alterations of the HNF1A gene, the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and the CTNNB1 gene. They recommend performing molecular analysis in order to better understand which lesions are likely to undergo malignant transformation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ectopic implantation of a blastocyst (ectopic pregnancy) that has ruptured could present similarly to what this patient is experiencing. Symptoms would include lower abdominal pain and unstable vitals. However, this patient's pain is more pronounced in the right upper quadrant and is occurring in the setting of OCP and possible anabolic steroid use.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation of the pancreas represents a diagnosis of pancreatitis. This would present with epigastric pain after a fatty meal or alcohol consumption. Though this patient does drink more than recommended and should be counseled to reduce her consumption, the pain began after exercising at the gym and there are no other symptoms of pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer C: Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein causes Budd-Chiari syndrome, which presents with a non-specific triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly in the setting of a hypercoagulable state (factor V Leiden, polycythemia vera, OCP use, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). Though this patient has risk factors for this pathology, they do not have any classic symptoms.\n\nAnswer D: Obstruction of the common bile duct with radio-opaque stones would present with colicky right upper quadrant pain in a patient that is \"fat, female, fertile, and forty.\" Though the pain presented in this case is localized to the right upper quadrant, it is not colicky and there is not a positive Murphy sign described. OCP's are a risk factor for cholesterol stones as are rapid weight loss, both of which this patient has. This is a strong possibility on the differential; however, the symptoms presented suggest a diagnosis of ruptured hepatic adenoma given the demographics of the patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA hepatic adenoma presents with right upper quadrant pain in the setting of OCP and/or androgen use and can rupture leading to unstable vitals.",

Given that he has no other associated injuries, trephination is the only management indicated.\n\nA subungual hematoma occurs after trauma to the finger leading to a collection of blood under the fingernail. Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children. The authors find that there was no difference in complications or outcomes between nail bed repair and trephination; however, the cost in the nail trephination group was lower. The authors recommend nail trephination for children with a subungual hematoma and an intact nail and nail margin.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows the physical exam finding of a subungual hematoma with a collection of blood underneath the fingernail bed (green circle).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Excision and histological examination could be appropriate management of melanoma, which may present under the fingernails with a hyperpigmented, irregular skin lesion, or a \u201cbarcode\u201d appearance if it is at the base of the nail. A spontaneous subungual hematoma could be suggestive of melanoma; however, in the setting of trauma, it is a much less likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer B: Fingernail removal should only be performed if there is also nail avulsion or nail fold disruption to allow for inspection of the nail bed and repair of any laceration. Failure to repair a nailbed laceration could lead to permanent deformity of the fingernail when it regrows.\n\nAnswer C: Observation is inappropriate as the accumulation of blood under the nail in a subungual hematoma could lead to ischemia and permanent injury to the nailbed. When a subungual hematoma is present, trephination is indicated.\n\nAnswer D: Operative repair may be necessary for fractures; however, this patient has no fracture and only has a subungual hematoma which can be drained easily.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA subungual hematoma is common after trauma, presents with a collection of blood under the fingernail, and should be treated with trephination.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with urticaria whenever she engages in sexual intercourse suggesting a latex allergy (found in condoms). These allergies are due to antigen exposure.\n\nAnaphylaxis and urticaria are immunologically mediated responses to environmental antigens that are typically IgE-mediated. This results in crosslinking of antigen receptors and the subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory signals. Patients can present with a spectrum of symptoms from urticaria (hives alone) all the way to full-blown anaphylaxis (hypotension, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction). Minor cases can be treated with avoidance of antigen exposure. Anaphylaxis is treated with intramuscular epinephrine (1:1,000).\n\nGawchik reviewed the evidence regarding the diagnosis of latex allergy. She discusses how the diagnosis is primarily made by observing the relationship between exposure and symptoms. She recommends avoidance of latex in these patients.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph that demonstrates dermal edema and urticaria (red circles). This can occur secondary to allergen exposure such as from a new drug or latex.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Drug reaction could be possible if this patient has an antibiotic allergy (ceftriaxone is a treatment for gonorrhea); however, a rash that only occurs during intercourse is more likely related to latex exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is possible given this patient\u2019s IV drug abuse and risky behavior; however, the hives present in this patient are likely not related to an infection. Infectious rashes tend to be painful, ulcerative, or vesicular.\n\nAnswer D: IV drug use could expose this patient to any number of foreign substances that could induce an allergic reaction; however, the symptoms that are associated with sexual intercourse point toward latex exposure.\n\nAnswer E: Photosensitivity would not present as hives but could occur in this patient given that doxycycline is an appropriate drug to treat her initial sexually transmitted infection and offers coverage for Chlamydia trachomatis. Patients would present with a photosensitive rash.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnaphylaxis and urticaria can occur secondary to latex exposure (such as from condoms or gloves).",

Here is the rationale for this conclusion:\n\n1. **Timing and Specificity of Rash**: The rash appears specifically after sexual activity, which strongly suggests a direct correlation with something encountered during these encounters. This timing is crucial in narrowing down the cause.\n\n2. **Allergic Reaction**: The patient's history and the nature of the rash suggest an allergic reaction. Common allergens encountered during sexual activity include latex (from condoms) or other bodily substances. This aligns with the insights provided by both the Innovative Medical Thinker and the Critical Medical Analyst.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Other Causes**:\n   - **Drug Reaction**: While the Clinical Decision Specialist suggests a drug reaction due to the recent start of antibiotics, the specificity of the rash appearing only after sexual activity makes this less likely. Drug reactions typically do not have such a specific trigger.\n   - **Infection**: Infections would likely present with additional symptoms and would not be so specifically timed with sexual activity.\n   - **IV Drug Use**: There is no indication that the rash is related to IV drug use, especially given the specific timing with sexual activity.\n   - **Photosensitivity**: This would be related to sun exposure and not sexual activity.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and the alignment of the symptoms with antigen exposure, the final decision is:\n\n**Final Answer: A (Antigen exposure)**",

The most appropriate next step is to repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir.\n\nHealthcare exposures to HIV are divided into 2 categories based on the level of contact with the source patient. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, immediate prophylaxis is recommended. This category also includes all needlestick exposures. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects. Prophylactic treatment should be initiated immediately (ideally within 1-2 hours) and continued for 4 weeks at which time the healthcare worker\u2019s serology should be repeated.\n\nParikh et al. studied technologies for monitoring HIV infection. They discuss how high throughput methods are required in order to surveil for infection on a population level. They recommend using next-generation sequencing methods to improve surveillance methods.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Immediately initiating triple antiretroviral therapy is appropriate after drawing the medical student\u2019s HIV serology. The patient\u2019s serology at the time of exposure must be established to compare to future testing. Despite her previous negative serology and low-risk lifestyle, it would still be best to repeat the testing at the same time prophylactic treatment is initiated.\n\nAnswer B: Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results is incorrect because this option would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Empiric treatment with a triple antiretroviral drug combination is appropriate for all patients with high-risk exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Waiting to hear that the medical student\u2019s HIV serology is negative would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Triple antiretroviral drug treatment should be initiated without waiting for the results. Empiric treatment of all patients with high-risk exposure is recommended in all cases.\n\nAnswer D: Waiting for the results of the medical student\u2019s serology would delay treatment for her exposure. If her serology is already positive, she will need to be treated past the 4-week period of prophylaxis. Even though she does not engage in high-risk behaviors, a positive serology would demonstrate that she was already infected with HIV.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAfter a needlestick injury from a HIV-positive source patient, a healthcare worker\u2019s HIV serology should be drawn and they should be immediately initiated on triple antiretroviral drug therapy.",

        "reason": "This patient presents with episodic epigastric pain and nausea that improves with the consumption of food, which suggests a diagnosis of a duodenal ulcer. Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers. They found that about many had confirmed infections. They recommend against empiric treatment without prior confirmation of infection.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Crypt abscesses are found on histology in ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients can also experience musculoskeletal pain, uveitis, and dermatologic findings such as erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum. Treatment may include mesalazine.\n\nAnswer B: A mucosal defect in the stomach is the pathologic description of a gastric ulcer. This patient\u2019s presentation of epigastric pain that improves with the consumption of food is more consistent with an ulcer in the duodenum. Treatment of a gastric ulcer may include proton pump inhibitors.\n\nAnswer C: Noncaseating granulomas are found on histology in Crohn disease. This patient denies any diarrhea (often associated with pain), which is the primary feature of Crohn disease. Other findings include abscesses, fistulas, and strictures. Treatment may include mesalamine and infliximab.\n\nAnswer D: PAS-positive material is found in the lamina propria on small intestinal biopsy in Whipple disease. In addition to abdominal pain, Whipple disease is characterized by diarrhea with flatulence and steatorrhea, fever, arthralgias, and weight loss. Treatment is with ceftriaxone or penicillin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDuodenal ulcers typically present with episodic epigastric abdominal that is improved after eating and are associated with H. pylori infection.",

Anti-ribonucleoprotein (U1) antibodies are found in this disease.\n\nMixed connective tissue disease can present with a vast array of symptoms. The most common symptoms are Raynaud phenomenon (vascular hyper-reactivity that presents with burning/pain in the hands where the hands change color from white to blue to red, seen in Figure A), arthralgias, myalgias, dysphagia, and edema of the hands. Anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibodies are commonly found in mixed connective tissue disease and are a specific marker. In this disease, there is typically an absence of renal involvement. Treatment involves steroids as well as calcium channel blockers for symptomatic control of Raynaud phenomenon.\n\nBatu et al. review the evidence regarding patients with mixed connective tissue disease. They found that many patients have overlapping symptoms with systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. They recommend studying patients with these mixed characteristics in order to better understand which treatment modalities are effective.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing the blanching of the distal fingers (red box). This finding demonstrates the Raynaud phenomenon during the early phase where the vessels have spasmed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anti-dsDNA is a specific marker in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE presents with SOAP BRAIN MD - Serositis, Oral ulcers, Arthritis, Photosensitivity, Blood disorders (hemolytic anemia, etc.), Renal involvement, ANA, Immune phenomena (anti-dsDNA, Smith), Neurological symptoms, Malar rash, and Discoid rash. Four of these criteria must be met to suspect a diagnosis of SLE. Treatment is with hydroxychloroquine.\n\nAnswer B: Anti-IgG Fc region is representative of rheumatoid factor which is found in rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis can present with fever, weight loss, and joint pain that worsens in the morning and improves with activity. It is common for the joints of the hands to become deformed due to the disease process. Treatment is with methotrexate.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are likely positive in this patient; however, they are not more likely to aid in making the diagnosis than anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies are. ANA are non-specific and can be found in many rheumatological conditions such as MCTD, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAnswer E: Anti-Ro antibodies are found in Sjogren syndrome which presents with dry eyes, dry mouth, dental caries, and dyspareunia. A salivary gland biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes artificial tears, vitamin D supplementation, and pilocarpine or cevimeline.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMixed connective tissue disease is associated with anti-ribonuleoprotein antibodies and presents with Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia/arthritis, swollen hands, sclerodactyly, and myositis.",

Supportive care is the most appropriate management strategy for patients with viral meningitis.\n\nAseptic (viral) meningitis presents similarly to bacterial meningitis with neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, malaise, and flu-like symptoms. Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, management of viral meningitis consists of supportive care and monitoring for complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or SIADH.\n\nKohil et. al review viral meningitis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestation and diagnosis. They recommend that most patients with viral meningitis be treated with supportive care.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acyclovir would be appropriate for suspected HSV or varicella encephalitis or meningitis. This patient with no RBCs in the CSF and no changes in mental status is not likely to have infection with HSV or varicella.\n\nAnswer B: Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine followed by long-term fluconazole is the appropriate management of cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis presents similarly to bacterial and viral meningitis, almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients.\n\nAnswer C: Ceftriaxone and vancomycin would be appropriate if bacterial meningitis was suspected. Steroids are generally added if a bacterial source is likely. However, this patient has a presentation that is less concerning for bacterial meningitis, and CSF studies that are more consistent with aseptic meningitis.\n\nAnswer D: Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and steroids are an appropriate initial regimen for bacterial meningitis.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with both absence seizures (periods of inattentiveness in school) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (abnormal, involuntary spasms of her upper extremity). The most appropriate treatment for these conditions is valproic acid.\n\nAbsence seizures classically present with cessation of motor activity and speech with a blank facial expression and occasionally automatisms such as flickering of the eyelids. They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer. It carries the potentially severe side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is not a first-line treatment for absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Stevens-Johnson syndrome will present with painful desquamation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAbsence seizures present with periods of inattentiveness and subtle automatisms and are most appropriately treated with ethosuximide or with valproic acid if there is concurrent juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

A muscle biopsy in this disease will demonstrate endomysial inflammation with basophilic-rimmed vacuoles within the muscle fiber sarcoplasm. Electromyography is typically abnormal, and the most accurate/confirmatory test is a muscle biopsy. There is no cure for this disease and no standard course of treatment. Corticosteroids are not usually effective but intravenous immunoglobulins can be effective.\n\nNaddaf et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with inclusion body myositis. They discuss how this disease is still refractory to treatment. They recommend a muscle biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a muscle biopsy demonstrating endomysial inflammation with basophilic-rimmed vacuoles (red circle) within the muscle fiber sarcoplasm. These findings are classically seen in patients with inclusion body myositis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 5: Dermatomyositis and polymyositis present similarly with muscle weakness and an elevated CK, CRP, and aldolase. However, dermatomyositis presents with dermatologic findings. A biopsy would demonstrate inflammation surrounding the muscle fascicle (dermatomyositis) or within the muscle fascicle (polymyositis). Treatment may include azathioprine and methotrexate.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia could present with weakness and cardiac abnormalities. Though this patient is hypokalemic, her biopsy demonstrates inclusion body myositis. Treatment of hypokalemia is with potassium repletion.\n\nAnswer C: Hypothyroidism presents with depression, fatigue, scarce lanugo, myopathy, and weight gain (as this patient has). Though myopathy from hypothyroidism is plausible, her symptoms of weakness have a confirmatory biopsy.

Rash is less common but possible.\n- **Dermatomyositis**: Characterized by muscle weakness and a distinctive rash (heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules). Muscle biopsy typically shows perifascicular atrophy.\n- **Polymyositis**: Presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy shows endomysial inflammation.\n- **Inclusion Body Myositis**: Typically affects older adults, with asymmetric muscle weakness and atrophy. Muscle biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles.\n- **Hypokalemia**: Can cause muscle weakness, but other symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, depression, sparse hair) are not typical.\n\n**Step 5: Correlation with Muscle Biopsy**\n- **Hypothyroidism**: Muscle biopsy may show type 2 fiber atrophy, but this is not specific.\n- **Dermatomyositis**: Muscle biopsy shows perifascicular atrophy.\n- **Polymyositis**: Muscle biopsy shows endomysial inflammation.\n- **Inclusion Body Myositis**: Muscle biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\n**A.

The potassium level is only slightly low and not likely the primary cause.\n\n**C. Hypothyroidism**\n- **Rationale**: The combination of fatigue, weight gain, depression, muscle weakness, and sparse hair fits well with hypothyroidism. However, the presence of a rash and the muscle biopsy findings (if showing perifascicular atrophy) would be less typical for hypothyroidism.\n\n**D. Inclusion Body Myositis**\n- **Rationale**: Typically presents with asymmetric muscle weakness and atrophy in older adults. The muscle biopsy would show rimmed vacuoles, which is not indicated here.\n\n**E. Polymyositis**\n- **Rationale**: Presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness.

They are susceptible to changes during respiratory infections.\n- **Lymph Nodes (Option D)**: Lymph nodes are integral to the immune response and often enlarge during infections.\n\nGiven the emphasis on the immune response and the likelihood of lymph node enlargement during infections, the most appropriate choice would be the lymph nodes.\n\n### Updated Answer:\n(D) D",
                "### Updated Thinking\n\nTo address the question, we need to consider the structures in the chest radiograph that are most likely to change in response to another infectious illness. The two previous insights from peers provide valuable perspectives:\n\n1. **Innovative Medical Thinker - MD**: Emphasizes that lung fields are most likely to show changes during respiratory infections due to infiltration or consolidation. This is a valid point as the lungs are directly involved in respiratory infections like pneumonia.\n\n2. **Clinical Decision Specialist - Medical Researcher**: Highlights that lymph nodes are directly associated with the immune response and are known to enlarge in response to infections. This is also a valid point as lymph nodes play a crucial role in the body's immune response to infections.\n\nGiven these insights, we need to weigh the likelihood of changes in the lung fields versus the lymph nodes in response to another infectious illness. \n\n- **Lung Fields (Option A)**: The lungs are the primary site affected by respiratory infections. Infiltration, consolidation, and other changes are commonly seen in the lung fields during infections like pneumonia.\n\n- **Lymph Nodes (Option D)**: Lymph nodes can enlarge in response to infections as part of the immune response. This enlargement can be seen in various infections, not just respiratory ones.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\nConsidering the nature of the question, which asks about the structure most likely to change in response to another infectious illness, and the fact that the patient has a history of bacterial pneumonia (a respiratory infection), the lungs are the primary site where changes are most likely to be observed. While lymph nodes do respond to infections, the lungs are more directly involved in respiratory illnesses and are more likely to show noticeable changes on a chest radiograph.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice is:\n\n**Updated Answer: (A) A**",

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a distended, tender abdomen with a radiograph demonstrating the \"coffee bean sign,\" likely has a cecal volvulus.\n\nCecal volvulus is the second most common cause of volvulus after sigmoid volvulus and presents with abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, abdominal distention, and a tympanitic abdomen. It is more common in young patients who are active (e.g. marathon runners). The classic conventional radiographic finding in cecal volvulus is the coffee bean sign, in which closed loops of intestine distend with gas, making visible the medial and lateral walls of dilated bowel. Diagnosis of cecal volvulus can be confirmed with a CT scan. Management involves analgesia, intravenous fluids, and surgical detorsion.\n\nHasbahceci et al. review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of cecal volvulus. The authors find that abdominal radiography has a low sensitivity for cecal volvulus. The authors recommend surgical management of cecal volvulus with resection with right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a radiograph demonstrating the \"coffee bean\" sign which is suggestive of a cecal volvulus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ileus presents after surgery or manipulation of the intestines with decreased peristalsis of the intestine leading to a failure to pass gas or have bowel movements. Treatment involves treating any electrolyte abnormalities, encouraging ambulation, and avoiding medications that decrease peristalsis (such as opioids).\n\nAnswer C: Ogilvie syndrome occurs when the colon wall is not appropriately undergoing peristalsis leading to a dilated colon with abdominal distension. It is more common in the elderly and critically ill patients. Treatment involves the placement of a rectal tube to decompress the intestines and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Sigmoid volvulus is more common in elderly and critically ill patients and presents with constipation, an absence of bowel movements, and a distended, tympanitic abdomen. Although the coffee bean sign may also be seen in patients with sigmoid volvulus, patients tend to be older. In addition, plain radiography typically demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels in a sigmoid volvulus versus usually only a single air-fluid level in a cecal volvulus. Treatment involves flexible sigmoidoscopy and surgery.\n\nAnswer E: Small bowel obstruction presents with a distended and tympanitic abdomen with nausea, vomiting, and an absence of flatus or bowel movements. Radiography may demonstrate distended bowel and air-fluid levels, and the most accurate test is a CT scan of the abdomen. It occurs secondary to adhesions entrapping the bowel. Management involves the placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous fluids, and surgery.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCecal volvulus presents in younger patients with abdominal pain, distention, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and the \"coffee bean\" sign on radiography.",

This sign is typically seen in cases of volvulus, where a loop of the bowel twists around itself and its mesentery.\n3. **Patient Demographics and Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a young, otherwise healthy individual with no history of surgeries or hernias, which makes cecal volvulus more likely than other types of bowel obstructions or conditions like ileus or Ogilvie syndrome.\n4. **Expert Consensus**: All three medical experts (Innovative Medical Thinker, Critical Medical Analyst, and Clinical Decision Specialist) have independently concluded that cecal volvulus is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings.\n\nGiven these points, the final answer is:\n\n**A) Cecal volvulus**",

The increased PTH results in renal phosphate wasting, increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and increased renal calcium reabsorption. It also results in increased osteoclast activity resulting in increased bone breakdown. This will lead to laboratory changes of hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia.\n\nTaniegra reviews the evidence regarding hyperparathyroidism. She discusses how this disease is usually discovered asymptomatically with routine blood work. She recommends surgical treatment with intractable cases as success rates are high.\n\nFigure A is a chest radiograph that is within normal limits. No masses are seen which suggests that malignancy is a less likely diagnosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Antacid overuse for this patient's GERD can lead to a milk-alkali syndrome which presents with hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis. This patient does not have metabolic alkalosis. Treatment is with the discontinuation of the offending agent.\n\nAnswer B: Increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D occurs in sarcoidosis which presents with cough, fatigue, and weight loss in an African American woman. Increased vitamin D by itself will result in hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia rather than hypophosphatemia. Treatment is supportive and/or with corticosteroids.\n\nAnswer D: Malignancy (lung or renal cancer) is possible given this patient's presentation. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a common feature with PTH-related protein effects; however, the patient's normal urinalysis and normal chest radiograph as well as non-smoking history point more toward a diagnosis of increased PTH.\n\nAnswer E: Viral illness is possible given this patient's systemic symptoms; however, it does not explain this patient's hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Treatment of seasonal viruses is generally supportive though specific viruses such as influenza have agents such as oseltamivir that may be helpful.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHyperparathyroidism presents with \"bones, stones, moans, and groans,\" as well as laboratory findings of hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia.",

Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block.

This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.",

The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber. Treatment is with diuresis and treatment of the underlying heart failure.\n\nAnswer D: A holosystolic murmur heard at the apex describes mitral valve regurgitation. This would be possible if a papillary muscle had ruptured in an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment is with mitral valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer E: A normal S1 and S2 is possible but is less likely given this patient's long-standing history of poorly managed hypertension.

The current presentation includes severely elevated blood pressure (180/120 mmHg), which is indicative of poorly controlled hypertension. The patient's pulse is also elevated at 96/min.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n\n1. **Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 (Option A)**:\n   - Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 is typically associated with atrial septal defect (ASD). There is no indication in the patient's history or current presentation that suggests an ASD.\n\n2. **Heart sound after S2 (Option B)**:\n   - A heart sound after S2 could indicate an S3 gallop, which is often associated with heart failure. However, the patient's history and current presentation are more suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) due to chronic hypertension.\n\n3. **Heart sound before S1 (Option C)**:\n   - An S4 heart sound occurs just before S1 and is associated with a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle, often due to chronic hypertension or previous myocardial infarction. This aligns well with the patient's history of hypertension and myocardial infarction.\n\n4. **Holosystolic murmur at the apex (Option D)**:\n   - A holosystolic murmur at the apex is typically associated with mitral regurgitation. While possible, there is no specific indication in the patient's history or current presentation that strongly suggests mitral regurgitation.\n\n5. **Normal S1 and S2 (Option E)**:\n   - Given the patient's significant cardiovascular history and current symptoms, it is unlikely that the cardiac exam would be completely normal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nConsidering the patient's history of hypertension and myocardial infarction, along with the current presentation of severely elevated blood pressure, the most likely cardiac finding would be an S4 heart sound.

LVH is often associated with an S4 heart sound, which occurs just before S1 due to the atrial contraction against a stiff left ventricle.\n\n2. **Current Presentation**: The patient presents with severely elevated blood pressure (180/120 mmHg), which further supports the likelihood of LVH. The elevated blood pressure indicates poorly controlled hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for LVH.\n\n3. **Medications and Compliance**: The patient has not been compliant with his medications, which likely exacerbates his hypertension and increases the risk of cardiac complications such as LVH.\n\n4. **Laboratory Values**: The laboratory values do not indicate acute renal failure or significant electrolyte imbalances that would suggest an acute cardiac event. The glucose level is elevated, consistent with his history of diabetes, but this does not directly impact the expected cardiac findings.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\nConsidering the patient's history of hypertension and myocardial infarction, along with the current presentation of severely elevated blood pressure, the most expected cardiac finding on physical examination would be an S4 heart sound. This sound occurs just before S1 and is indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is a common consequence of chronic hypertension and previous myocardial infarction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Heart sound before S1",
                "### Updated Thinking\n\nGiven the patient's significant medical history, including hypertension and a previous myocardial infarction, it is crucial to consider the cardiac implications of these conditions. Hypertension and myocardial infarction can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and potentially heart failure. LVH is often associated with a stiffened ventricular wall, which can result in an S4 heart sound. This sound occurs due to the atria contracting forcefully to overcome the stiffened ventricle, and it is heard just before S1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Patient History**: The patient has a history of hypertension and myocardial infarction, both of which are risk factors for LVH.\n2. **Current Symptoms and Vital Signs**: The patient presents with elevated blood pressure (180/120 mmHg), which suggests poorly controlled hypertension. This further supports the likelihood of LVH.\n3. **Laboratory Values**: The laboratory values are relatively unremarkable except for elevated glucose, which is consistent with his diabetes. The creatinine level is within normal limits, indicating no acute kidney injury.\n4. **Medications**: The patient is on medications that manage hypertension (metoprolol, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide), diabetes (metformin, insulin), and depression (fluoxetine). However, he has not been compliant with his medication regimen, which could exacerbate his hypertension and contribute to cardiac complications.\n5. **Expected Cardiac Findings**: Given the history of myocardial infarction and severe hypertension, the most likely cardiac finding would be related to LVH.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with recurrent episodes of significant swelling of his lips and tongue with minor trauma, which are concerning for hereditary angioedema. Fresh frozen plasma is the most effective therapy for hereditary angioedema of the options listed.\n\nAngioedema is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with severe edema of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. It can be caused by antigens, medications, and trauma or may occur spontaneously. It often presents with notable edema of the lips and tongue and may threaten the airway. There are 3 subtypes. Hereditary and acquired angioedema occur secondary to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. As a result, the most effective therapy is to administer fresh frozen plasma which has C1-esterase inhibitor. On the other hand, drug-induced angioedema (often from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) does not respond well to C1-esterase inhibitor replacement and supportive therapy; discontinuing the offending agent is the mainstay of therapy. Other effective but costly treatments that can be used in hereditary angioedema include: icatibant, ecallantide, and C1 inhibitor.\n\nPaige and Anderson note the management of hereditary angioedema. They review the different treatments and discuss C1-esterase inhibitor replacement. They recommend this treatment for acute episodes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Dexamethasone and other steroids can be given in acute allergic reactions and may reduce the recurrence of symptoms but are unlikely to be effective in angioedema, nor are they the most effective therapy. Steroids can take up to 4 hours to begin having any effect.\n\nAnswer B: Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that could be given for anaphylaxis or urticaria and works immediately; however, it is not the mainstay of therapy for angioedema nor is it the most effective therapy. It is the mainstay of therapy for urticaria. It can also be given in anaphylaxis.\n\nAnswer C: Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis which presents with urticaria, upper airway swelling, hypotension, nausea/vomiting, and wheezing. It is often given in angioedema but has limited efficacy when compared to fresh frozen plasma.\n\nAnswer E: Tranexamic acid is effective in treating angioedema and current evidence supports its use; however, the mainstay of therapy is still fresh frozen plasma. Tranexamic acid is also used in hemorrhagic shock to stop fibrinolysis and reduce bleeding.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA possible treatment in hereditary or acquired angioedema is the administration of fresh frozen plasma to replace C1-esterase inhibitor.",

The acute management of HAE, especially when there is airway involvement, is critical to prevent life-threatening airway obstruction.\n\nThe three experts provided different perspectives:\n\n1. **Innovative Medical Thinker - MD** and **Critical Medical Analyst - Medical Professor** both concluded that Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) is the most effective therapy. FFP contains C1 esterase inhibitor, which is deficient in patients with HAE, and can help to rapidly replenish this inhibitor and reduce swelling.\n\n2. **Clinical Decision Specialist - Medical Researcher** suggested that epinephrine is the most immediate and effective treatment for acute airway compromise. Epinephrine is commonly used in anaphylaxis to reduce airway swelling and improve breathing.\n\nHowever, the patient's presentation and history are more consistent with hereditary angioedema rather than anaphylaxis. In HAE, the swelling is due to a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor, and epinephrine is not typically effective in these cases. Instead, treatments that address the underlying deficiency, such as FFP, are more appropriate.\n\nGiven the context and the specific needs of a patient with hereditary angioedema experiencing acute airway compromise, the most effective therapy would be one that directly addresses the underlying cause of the swelling.\n\nTherefore, the final decision is:\n\n**Final Answer: D (Fresh Frozen Plasma)**\n\nRationale: Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) provides the necessary C1 esterase inhibitor that the patient lacks, making it the most effective immediate therapy for hereditary angioedema with acute airway compromise.",

He states that he lives at home with his parents his entire life and recently was able to get a job at a local factory. Ever since the patient started working, he has had trouble focusing on his job. He is unable to stay focused on any task. His boss often observes him \"daydreaming\" with a blank stare off into space. His boss will have to yell at him to startle him back to work. The patient states that he feels fatigued all the time and sometimes will suddenly fall asleep while operating equipment. He has tried going to bed early for the past month but is unable to fall asleep until 2 hours prior to his alarm. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/68 mmHg, pulse is 81/min, and respirations are 12/min. A physical exam is within normal limits.

The most appropriate initial therapy is light therapy, behavioral therapy, and sleep hygiene practices in addition to decreasing exposure to light at night.\n\nDelayed sleep phase syndrome typically presents with individuals who naturally fall asleep very late and wake up very late. This becomes problematic when they attend school or have a job that requires them to wake up early. The most appropriate initial therapy for delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene practices, and bright light therapy. Bright light therapy involves consistent timed exposure to a light box to simulate natural outdoor light, with the hope of resetting the circadian rhythm and moving the sleep phase earlier. If these measures fail, or if a different diagnosis is suspected, a referral for polysomnography may be indicated.\n\nSletten et al. studied whether melatonin was effective in the treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome. They found that using this medication as an adjunct to sleep hygiene was effective in improving symptoms. They recommend using multimodal therapy for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ethosuximide is the treatment of choice for absence seizures. Though this patient does have episodes of blank staring, this likely does not represent a seizure as he is arousable to return to work by his boss. Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy. Though this patient does have sudden episodes of falling asleep while at work, this is more likely to be related to his sleep schedule. Patients with narcolepsy generally do not feel tired immediately before their episodes of sleep.\n\nAnswer E: Zolpidem is a muscle relaxant and hypnotic with the mechanism of action of a benzodiazepine. Though a drug like zolpidem could be used to help this patient fall asleep, the most appropriate first step is to address the patient's sleep hygiene prior to prescribing a potentially addictive drug.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep hygiene.",

His wife recently had symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea after returning from a cruise, suggesting a possible infectious etiology. However, the patient's symptoms have persisted for a week, which is somewhat atypical for a simple viral gastroenteritis.\n\n2. **Medical History**: The patient has poorly managed diabetes, constipation, anxiety, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. These conditions can contribute to various gastrointestinal and systemic issues.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**: The patient has a slightly elevated temperature (99.5\u00b0F), significantly elevated blood pressure (197/128 mmHg), a pulse of 100/min, and normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. The elevated blood pressure and pulse could be stress-related or secondary to another underlying condition.\n\n4. **Physical Exam**:\n   - **Cardiac**: Systolic murmur loudest along the left upper sternal border, which could indicate aortic stenosis or another valvular issue.\n   - **Abdominal**: Obese, tympanitic, and distended abdomen with a scar in the right lower quadrant, suggesting a history of abdominal surgery.\n   - **Vascular**: Weak pulses in the lower extremities, which could indicate peripheral artery disease.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Adhesions**: Given the history of abdominal surgery (scar in the right lower quadrant), adhesions could cause bowel obstruction, leading to nausea and vomiting.\n   - **Enteric Nervous System Damage**: This could be related to poorly managed diabetes, leading to gastroparesis, but it is less likely to cause acute symptoms.\n   - **Impacted Stool**: Constipation history could lead to fecal impaction, causing nausea and vomiting.\n   - **Norovirus**: The wife's recent illness suggests a viral etiology, but the patient's symptoms are more chronic.\n   - **Twisting of the Bowel (Volvulus)**: This could cause acute obstruction and is a surgical emergency.\n\n### Answer\n\n**A. Adhesions**\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- The patient's history of abdominal surgery (scar in the right lower quadrant) makes adhesions a likely cause of bowel obstruction.\n- Symptoms of nausea and vomiting, exacerbated by large meals and alcohol, are consistent with partial bowel obstruction.\n- The distended and tympanitic abdomen supports the diagnosis of bowel obstruction.\n- Adhesions are a common cause of bowel obstruction in patients with a history of abdominal surgery.\n\n**B. Enteric Nervous System Damage**:\n- While diabetes can cause enteric nervous system damage, leading to gastroparesis, the acute nature of the symptoms and the exacerbation with large meals and alcohol are less typical for this condition.\n\n**C. Impacted Stool**:\n- Although the patient has a history of constipation, the presentation of nausea and vomiting with a distended abdomen is more suggestive of a mechanical obstruction rather than fecal impaction.\n\n**D. Norovirus**:\n- The wife's recent illness suggests a viral etiology, but the chronicity and severity of the patient's symptoms are less typical for a simple viral gastroenteritis.\n\n**E. Twisting of the Bowel (Volvulus)**:\n- This is a possible cause of acute obstruction, but the history of abdominal surgery makes adhesions a more likely etiology.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most likely underlying etiology of this patient's symptoms is **(A) Adhesions**.",

Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **History of Abdominal Surgery**: The patient has a scar in the right lower quadrant, suggesting previous abdominal surgery. This increases the risk of adhesions, which can lead to bowel obstruction. Symptoms such as abdominal distension and exacerbation with eating are consistent with this.\n\n2. **Recent Travel and Infectious Symptoms**: The patient's wife recently returned from a cruise with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, which raises the possibility of an infectious cause like Norovirus. This virus is known for causing acute gastroenteritis and can spread easily in close quarters like cruise ships.\n\n3. **Exacerbation with Fatty Meals and Alcohol**: This could suggest a gastrointestinal issue that is sensitive to dietary triggers, such as gallbladder disease or pancreatitis. However, these conditions are not directly listed in the options.\n\n4. **Medical History**: The patient has poorly managed diabetes, which can lead to complications such as gastroparesis (enteric nervous system damage). However, this typically presents with chronic symptoms rather than an acute onset.\n\n5. **Physical Exam Findings**: The distended and tympanitic abdomen suggests a buildup of gas or fluid, which can be seen in bowel obstruction. The weak pulses in the lower extremities could indicate peripheral vascular disease, but this is less likely to be the primary cause of the acute gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\nConsidering the above points, the most likely underlying etiology of the patient's symptoms is:\n\n**(A) Adhesions**\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- **Adhesions**: The patient's history of abdominal surgery and the presentation of symptoms (abdominal distension, exacerbation with eating) strongly suggest bowel obstruction due to adhesions. This is a common complication after abdominal surgery and fits well with the clinical picture.\n  \n- **Norovirus**: While the recent travel and wife's symptoms suggest an infectious cause, the patient's symptoms of exacerbation with fatty meals and alcohol, along with the physical exam findings, are more indicative of a mechanical obstruction rather than an infectious gastroenteritis.\n\n- **Enteric nervous system damage**: This is less likely given the acute nature of the symptoms. Gastroparesis typically presents with chronic symptoms.\n\n- **Impacted stool**: This could cause similar symptoms but is less likely given the history of abdominal surgery and the distended, tympanitic abdomen.\n\n- **Twisting of the bowel**: This is a possibility but is less common than adhesions and would typically present with more acute, severe pain.\n\nTherefore, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's symptoms is **(A) Adhesions**."

The treatment of choice is to remove the object which may be done in the emergency department or operating room depending on how deep the object is. Visualization of the object should be attempted when possible in order to allow for safe retrieval.\n\nKrulewitz and Fix review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epistaxis. They discuss how foreign body insertion is a major risk factor for the development of epistaxis. They recommend assessment of airway and breathing in the setting of severe epistaxis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: A bleeding and infected vessel of the Kiesselbach plexus could suggest a complicated case of epistaxis. The persistent, unilateral symptoms in this patient point toward a different diagnosis. A high index of suspicion for foreign bodies should be suspected in children.\n\nAnswer C: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to occur in young male patients and can be associated with infectious mononucleosis. Epistaxis can be a symptom and the mass can be visualized. This disease tends to present in older patients and is far less common than foreign bodies. Treatment is with surgical resection.\n\nAnswer D: Septal perforation can occur secondary to repeat cocaine use but would not present with unilateral nasal discharge in a pediatric patient. It would be highly unlikely in a pediatric patient with no history of drug use.

The key finding on physical examination is a unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood from the nose.\n\n2. **Vital Signs and Physical Exam**: \n   - Temperature: 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C) - Mildly elevated, not indicative of high fever.\n   - Blood Pressure: 90/48 mmHg - Normal for a child.\n   - Pulse: 124/min - Slightly elevated, could be due to pain or anxiety.\n   - Respirations: 17/min - Normal.\n   - Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air - Normal.\n   - Cardiopulmonary exam: Normal.\n   - Nasal exam: Unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood.\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Bleeding and infected vessel of Kiesselbach plexus**: This typically presents with epistaxis (nosebleed) but not necessarily with purulent discharge.\n   - **Foreign body obstruction**: Common in children and can cause unilateral purulent discharge, often with a foul smell and sometimes blood.\n   - **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**: Rare in children and would likely present with more systemic symptoms and possibly a mass.\n   - **Septal perforation**: Can cause bleeding but less likely to cause purulent discharge.\n   - **Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection**: Likely given the history of acute sinusitis and worsening symptoms, including purulent discharge.\n\n4. **Most Likely Diagnosis**:\n   - The presence of unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood in a child with a history of acute sinusitis suggests a complication or secondary issue. Given the commonality and the symptoms, a foreign body obstruction is highly likely, especially in children, and can explain the unilateral nature of the symptoms and the presence of blood.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(B) Foreign body obstruction",
                "### Thinking:\n\n1. **Patient History and Symptoms**:\n   - **Age**: 7-year-old boy.\n   - **Initial Diagnosis**: Acute sinusitis.\n   - **Current Symptoms**: Worsening symptoms, nasal discharge with blood, worsening pain.\n   - **Medical History**: Well-controlled asthma.\n   - **Vital Signs**: Mildly elevated pulse (124/min), otherwise normal vitals.\n   - **Physical Exam**: Unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood, otherwise normal.\n\n2. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **(A) Bleeding and infected vessel of Kiesselbach plexus**:\n     - Kiesselbach plexus is a common site for nosebleeds, but it typically presents with anterior nasal bleeding, not purulent discharge.\n   - **(B) Foreign body obstruction**:\n     - Common in children, can cause unilateral purulent discharge, and sometimes blood if the mucosa is damaged.\n   - **(C) Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**:\n     - Extremely rare in children, more common in adults, and typically presents with more systemic symptoms.\n   - **(D) Septal perforation**:\n     - Can cause bleeding, but less likely to cause purulent discharge unless infected.\n   - **(E) Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection**:\n     - Likely given the history of acute sinusitis, worsening symptoms, and purulent discharge. Blood in the discharge can occur due to mucosal irritation or damage.\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is **(B) Foreign body obstruction**. This is because:\n- The patient is a child, and foreign body obstruction is common in this age group.\n- The unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood is a classic presentation for a foreign body in the nose.\n- The worsening pain and discharge suggest an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process, which can be secondary to a foreign body.\n\nThus, the most likely diagnosis is **(B) Foreign body obstruction**."

        "final_raw_response": "Based on the detailed analysis provided by the three medical experts, the most likely diagnosis for the 7-year-old boy presenting with unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood and worsening pain is a foreign body obstruction. Here is the rationale for this conclusion:\n\n1. **Symptom Specificity**: The unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood is a key symptom that strongly suggests a localized issue within the nasal passage. This type of presentation is highly indicative of a foreign body obstruction, especially in children who are prone to inserting objects into their noses.\n\n2. **Commonality in Children**: Foreign body obstruction is a common occurrence in pediatric patients. Children often insert small objects into their nasal passages, which can lead to localized infection, purulent discharge, and sometimes bleeding.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses**:\n   - **Bleeding and infected vessel of Kiesselbach plexus (A)**: This condition typically presents with epistaxis (nosebleed) but not necessarily with purulent discharge.\n   - **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (C)**: This is a rare condition in children and would likely present with more systemic symptoms and possibly bilateral findings.\n   - **Septal perforation (D)**: This condition usually presents with crusting, bleeding, and whistling sounds during breathing, but not typically with purulent discharge.\n   - **Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection (E)**: While sinusitis can cause purulent discharge, the unilateral nature and presence of blood make a foreign body obstruction more likely.\n\n4. **Expert Consensus**: All three medical experts (Innovative Medical Thinker - MD, Critical Medical Analyst - Medical Professor, and Clinical Decision Specialist - Medical Researcher) independently concluded that the most likely diagnosis is a foreign body obstruction, further supporting this diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the final decision is:\n\n**Final Answer: B (Foreign body obstruction)**",
        "final_thinking": "After analyzing the symptoms, common issues in children, and ruling out other diagnoses based on the specific presentation of purulent discharge mixed with blood, the conclusion is drawn that the most likely diagnosis is a foreign body obstruction.
