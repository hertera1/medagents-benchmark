Acromegaly, in particular, is known for causing increased bone growth, including the mandible, and can lead to increased interdental spaces.\n- Hyperthyroidism (B) involves an overactive thyroid gland, which primarily affects metabolism and does not typically cause increased bone growth in the mandible.\n- Hypopituitarism (C) is the underproduction of pituitary hormones, which would not cause increased bone growth.\n- Hyperparathyroidism (D) involves excessive production of parathyroid hormone, affecting calcium levels and bone metabolism, but it does not typically cause the described mandibular changes.\n\nGiven the characteristic symptoms described in the question, hyperpituitarism (A) is the most likely cause.
