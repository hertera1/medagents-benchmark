The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated.

She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks?\"",
