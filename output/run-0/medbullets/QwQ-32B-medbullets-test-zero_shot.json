        "question": "A 64-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a headache and nausea. He reports that he was rocking his grandson to sleep when the symptoms began. He states the pain is constant and is primarily located on his right side. When asked to indicate the area of pain, he says that it surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/91 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient\u2019s right eye is shown in Figure A. Upon physical examination, the right pupil is minimally responsive to light and the globe feels firm. A right-sided carotid bruit is appreciated.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden-onset unilateral vision loss and an orbitofrontal headache with a dilated pupil and a hard ocular globe suggesting a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 64-year-old man with a headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual issues. The key points here are the location of the pain around the eye and upper forehead on the right side, difficulty seeing out of the right eye with tearing, a minimally responsive pupil, a firm globe, and a right-sided carotid bruit. His history includes hypertension and he's on hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nFirst, the symptoms point towards increased intracranial pressure. The eye symptoms like pain around the eye, vision problems, a dilated and non-responsive pupil (which could indicate a cranial nerve issue, maybe III nerve palsy), and a firm globe (which might mean elevated intraocular pressure) make me think of conditions like glaucoma or maybe a mass effect. But the carotid bruit is important too. Since he has hypertension and a carotid bruit, maybe there's a vascular issue here.\n\nWait, the right eye's globe feeling firm suggests increased intraocular pressure. But the headache and other symptoms could be due to something else. The combination of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and ophthalmoplegia (like a third nerve palsy) might point to a condition like a cerebral aneurysm, but the carotid bruit makes me think of carotid artery disease. Alternatively, maybe he's having an acute angle-closure glaucoma attack. Let me think again.\n\nIn angle-closure glaucoma, you get sudden onset of pain, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and the eye is red and firm. The pupil might be mid-dilated and non-reactive. The presence of a carotid bruit might be a distractor, but the key here is the eye findings. The question is about prophylaxis for his condition. If it's angle-closure glaucoma, prophylactic treatment would involve medications to prevent future attacks. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used in glaucoma. Amitriptyline is an antidepressant, maybe for neuropathic pain. Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet. Epinephrine is a stimulant. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker.\n\nWait, but another angle: the carotid bruit and hypertension. If the patient has a carotid artery stenosis (given the bruit), and maybe a transient ischemic attack or something related.",

A calcium channel blocker such as verapamil would only slow conduction in the AV node.\n\nThe conduction velocity of cardiac tissue is determined by a wide variety of factors, including the number and identity of various ion channels, the number and type of gap junctions, and the size and composition of muscle fibers. Conduction through the Purkinje system is the fastest within the heart, allowing for coordinated contraction of the ventricles, and atrial muscle conducts faster than ventricular muscle. Conduction through the AV node is the slowest, to allow the ventricles enough time to fill with blood.\n\nBonke et al. review the evidence regarding the conduction velocity of parts of the heart. They discuss how the AV node is slower than the SA node. They recommend understanding how different parts of the heart conducts electricity.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers A-C & E: These choices do not correspond to the correct conduction velocities in each part of the cardiac conduction system. A calcium channel blocker would not change the relative velocities of conduction in Purkinje fibers, atria, and ventricles.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe conduction velocity through the heart in order of speed is Purkinje fibers > atria > ventricles > AV node.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about the relative conduction speed through the heart from fastest to slowest when someone is on verapamil during exercise. Hmm, first, I need to remember the normal conduction pathway and the speeds of each part.\n\nThe heart's conduction system starts in the SA node, then goes to the AV node, through the Bundle of His, Bundle branches, and finally the Purkinje fibers. But the question is about the conduction speed in different regions. \n\nI recall that the Purkinje fibers have the fastest conduction speed. They're responsible for quickly depolarizing the ventricles. Then the ventricular muscle itself conducts a bit slower. The atria have a slower conduction compared to the Purkinje fibers but maybe faster than the AV node? Wait, the AV node is known for having a slower conduction, right? It's the slowest part of the normal conduction system, which causes the delay before the ventricles contract. \n\nSo putting them in order from fastest to slowest: Purkinje fibers first, then ventricles, then atria, and the AV node is the slowest. Wait, but the options might have different arrangements. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says Purkinje > ventricles > atria > AV node. That seems right based on what I was thinking. But wait, the atria's conduction speed compared to ventricles? Wait, actually, the ventricular muscle (myocardium) conducts faster than the atrial muscle. So ventricles are faster than atria. So the order would be Purkinje (fastest), then ventricles, then atria, then AV node (slowest). So that's option C. \n\nBut wait, the question mentions verapamil. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker, right? It affects the conduction through the AV node, slowing it down more. But does it affect the Purkinje fibers or the atria/ventricles? I think verapamil primarily affects the AV node, slowing conduction there even more. However, the question is about the relative speeds during verapamil administration. But the options don't have a changed order due to the drug, maybe because the question is asking for the normal conduction speeds, or perhaps the drug doesn't change the relative order, just the absolute speeds. \n\nWait, the",

        "reason": "This patient who presents with trouble following directions, inconsistent response to the physician's questions, and lack of progression in her language skills may have an acquired hearing impairment. The patient should undergo audiometry testing.\n\nHearing impairment in children can be genetic or acquired. In a patient with a history of recurrent ear infections, conductive hearing loss is the most common underlying cause of hearing impairment. Hearing impairment can often present similarly to behavioral or persistent developmental disorders. In a child with poor language skills, social skills, and self-isolation, hearing loss should be ruled out first before considering other diagnoses. Undetected hearing loss can progress with poor academic performance, personal-social maladjustment, and emotional difficulties as children progress through critical development stages. The treatment for hearing loss is the restoration of hearing through hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other supportive measures.\n\nDammeyer et al. studied the impact of childhood hearing loss on family life. They found that children with additional disabilities were more likely to be ignored by parents. They recommend understanding family dynamics in order to better support patients and families.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer B: Autism spectrum screening questionnaire is useful in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in children presenting with social isolation and poor communication skills. Autism spectrum disorder often presents with repetitive behaviors and fixed interests, which are absent in this child. Hearing loss should be ruled out first before pursuing this diagnosis. Treatment of autism spectrum disorders is early intervention and counseling.\n\nAnswer C: Parent and teacher ADHD rating scales should be obtained to aid in the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While children with ADHD often appear inattentive and impulsive in multiple domains, poor language development, and social isolation are not features of ADHD. This patient should first undergo an audiometry test. ADHD can be treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate.\n\nAnswer D: Referral for genetic testing is an incorrect first step in the management of this patient. While delayed language can be seen with several genetic conditions, there are usually signs of other global motor, cognitive, and social delays. Additional genetic testing can be pursued if the patient\u2019s audiometry testing results are normal.\n\nAnswer E: Referral for speech and language assessment is an incorrect first step. A formal assessment should be obtained in the diagnosis of communication and language disorders. However, this should only be done after ruling out hearing loss. Therefore audiometric testing should be performed first.\n\nBullet Summary:\nChildren with a history of recurrent ear infections presenting with signs of social or language development delays should be evaluated for hearing impairment with an audiometry test.",

Her older brother has ADHD, but the rest of the family is fine. The main concerns now are her becoming more withdrawn and ignoring her parents when asked to do tasks, which has gotten worse in the last 8 weeks. She's energetic and started preschool recently. Her physical exam is normal except for being distracted and not responding much during the visit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider possible causes for her behavioral changes. The key symptoms here are withdrawal and not responding to directions. The question is asking for the next best step in management. Let's look at the options.\n\nOption A is audiometry testing. Since she had several ear infections, maybe there's some hearing loss. Hearing issues can lead to not responding, so that's a possibility. But she's been to preschool and her language skills are the same as before. If her hearing was suddenly worse, maybe her language would have regressed? But the problem is she's been ignoring tasks, which could be due to not hearing, but maybe not. Still, audiometry is a consideration.\n\nOption B is autism spectrum screening. The symptoms of withdrawal and not responding to directions could be red flags for autism. The fact that she's more withdrawn and not engaging as before, especially since starting preschool, might be social communication issues. The screening questionnaire like M-CHAT or something similar would be appropriate here.\n\nOption C is ADHD rating scales. Her brother has ADHD, so there's a family history. But ADHD usually presents with hyperactivity, impulsivity, or inattention. The problem here is more about withdrawal and not responding, which might be more in line with inattention, but ADHD in a 3-year-old can be tricky. However, the key is that she's been ignoring tasks, which could be inattention. But the timing (since starting preschool) might be a social adjustment, but the question says it's been 8 weeks. Also, the fact that she's energetic might fit ADHD, but the main symptoms here are more about social withdrawal. Maybe not the first step.\n\nOption D is genetic testing. There's no mention of dysmorphic features or other physical signs that would suggest a genetic disorder. The neurological exam is normal, so maybe not the first step.\n\nOption E is speech and language assessment. Her language skills are unchanged from 6 months ago, so if they were normal before, maybe not.",

Note that digoxin can be given in patients with poor cardiac function and atrial fibrillation; thus it is a plausible home medication for this patient.\n\nDigoxin is a cardiac glycoside that is used in conditions such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation. While it does not lower mortality, it may reduce symptoms of heart failure. Digoxin toxicity classically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea/vomiting), blurred vision or yellow halos, and cardiac dysrhythmias. While there is a myriad of dysrhythmias, digoxin can cause bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular contractions. ST-segment scooping can be seen with digoxin use both in toxicity but also with regular therapeutic use. Toxicity is treated with anti-digoxin antibodies.\n\nPatocka et al review digoxin toxicity. They note that this medication has a narrow therapeutic range and recommend close monitoring. Toxicity depends on severity and can be treated with anti-digoxin antibodies.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bradycardia and premature ventricular complexes (red circles). This is consistent with digoxin toxicity.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antidyshythmic agent with toxicities including bradycardia, heart block, a prolonged QT interval, hepatitis, interstitial lung disease, hypothyroidism, corneal deposits and optic neuropathy. This patient could use amiodarone for his atrial fibrillation, but the visual disturbances are more typical of digoxin toxicity.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that would cause hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperglycemia. Treatment would involve immediate administration of calcium and vasopressors such as epinephrine. Other treatments in severe toxicity may include glucagon, dextrose, and insulin (to increase cardiac contractility).\n\nAnswer D: Procainamide is the preferred antidysrhythmic in tachydysrhythmias associated with Wolff Parkinson White syndrome. It may cause drug-induced lupus and other dysrhythmias in overdose but would not cause this patient\u2019s constellation of symptoms. Procainiamide is used rarely for atrial fibrillation and is only available for intravenous infusion in the US.\n\nAnswer E: Propranolol toxicity would present with bradycardia, hypotension, confusion, seizures, and hypoglycemia. Treatment is centered on glucagon, calcium, and vasopressors such as epinephrine. In severe toxicity, lipid emulsion therapy and insulin/dextrose should be administered.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDigoxin toxicity may present with nausea, vomiting, visual changes, bradycardia, and premature ventricular complexes.",

His symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, fainting when standing, and a yellow tint to his vision. The vital signs show a low heart rate (40/min), elevated blood pressure (153/91), and normal temp, respirations, and oxygen saturation. The ECG is mentioned but we can't see it, so maybe the key is in the options and the symptoms.\n\nThe question is asking for the most likely medication causing his symptoms. The options are all medications, so we need to think about their side effects. Let's go through each option:\n\nAmiodarone (A) is an antiarrhythmic, often used in heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It can cause hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, but the main side effects I remember are pulmonary toxicity, skin changes, and maybe bradycardia. But does it cause visual changes like a yellow tint? I think amiodarone can cause corneal deposits, but a yellow tint might be more specific to another drug.\n\nDigoxin (B) is used in heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Its toxicity is well-known. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and visual disturbances like yellow halos (xanthopsia). The ECG changes in digoxin toxicity can include hyperkalemia effects, like peaked T waves, but also conduction delays. The patient's heart rate is 40, which is bradycardia. Digoxin can slow the heart, especially in toxicity. The combination of bradycardia, GI symptoms, visual changes, and the patient's history of heart failure (where digoxin is commonly used) points towards digoxin toxicity here.\n\nDiltiazem (C) is a calcium channel blocker, used for hypertension, angina, or arrhythmias. It can cause bradycardia and hypotension. But the BP here is elevated, so maybe not. The visual changes aren't typical for diltiazem. More likely side effects are dizziness, headache, constipation.\n\nProcainamide (D) is another antiarrhythmic, class IA. It can cause\u72fc\u75ae\u6837 syndrome, arrhythm",

Symptoms are normally gradual in onset and can include headache, fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia. The most appropriate initial test is a lumbar puncture with an India ink stain. Cerebrospinal fluid in fungal meningitis would have low glucose, elevated protein, and an elevated lymphocyte-dominant leukocyte count. The most accurate diagnostic test is latex particle agglutination. Intrathecal amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine are the first-line treatments for acute management.

The leukocyte count is 200 with 100% lymphocytes. \n\nIndia ink stain positive is a big clue here. That's used to detect Cryptococcus neoformans, which is a fungus. So, cryptococcal meningitis is the likely diagnosis here. The low CD4 count makes her susceptible to opportunistic infections like this. The symptoms of headache, neck stiffness, fever, and the CSF findings (high opening pressure, low glucose, high protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis) all fit with meningitis. The India ink positive confirms cryptococcus.\n\nNow, the treatment options. The question asks which treatment most directly addresses the underlying cause. The underlying cause here is the cryptococcal meningitis. So the correct treatment would be antifungal therapy. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Acyclovir: That's",

She presented with similar symptoms 6 weeks ago and was treated for an Escherchia coli infection. She also was treated for a urinary tract infection 10 weeks ago. Her mother says that last night her daughter felt ill, and her condition has been worsening. Her daughter experienced a severe headache and had a stiff neck. This morning she was minimally responsive, vomited several times, and produced a small amount of dark cloudy urine. The patient was born at 39 weeks and met all her developmental milestones. She is currently up to date on her vaccinations and did not have infections during early childhood. Her parents are divorced and her father has noted she does not seem to get sick when he takes care of her.

Typically, this is a parent feigning or creating symptoms in a child in order to receive the psychiatric gain of attention from healthcare personnel.

Factitious disorder by proxy should be suspected in any pediatric patient who has repeat infections that are atypical or not expected epidemiologically. Patients should also be evaluated for organic causes of symptoms such as immunodeficiency syndromes.\n\nAbeln and Love review the evidence regarding the diagnosis of factitious disorder by proxy. They discuss how these disorders have high morbidity and mortality when not accurately recognized. They recommend paying attention to red flags such as abnormal constellations of symptoms.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Gastroenteritis would present with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; however, it would not present with sepsis routinely. Gastroenteritis does not best explain the most likely underlying cause of this patient's presentation.\n\nAnswer B: Immunodeficiency such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) would present with lifelong infections from birth that are bacterial, viral, and fungal. Immunodeficiency would not present with repeat infections in a pediatric patient only when they are with one patient.\n\nAnswer D: Meningitis would present with headache, altered mental status, and meningeal signs. In the setting of repeat sepsis in a healthy pediatric patient, intentional contamination is more likely. Similarly, an absence of photophobia and no further history/physical exam supporting this diagnosis suggests an alternative diagnosis.\n\nAnswer E: Urinary tract infection would present with dysuria rather than repeat episodes of sepsis. Though a urinary tract infection could lead to sepsis, this would be rare and more likely to occur in an immunosuppressed patient, the elderly, or a neonate.

Now she's presenting with fever, behavioral changes, stiff neck, severe headache, vomiting, and altered responsiveness. Her vital signs show low blood pressure and high heart rate, which might indicate sepsis.\n\nFirst, the stiff neck and headache are classic signs of meningitis. The fact that she was treated for E. coli before could be a clue. E. coli can sometimes cause UTIs, and if it ascended to the kidneys, maybe there's a connection. But the current symptoms point more towards meningitis. The dark cloudy urine might suggest a UTI recurrence, but the neurological symptoms are more concerning.\n\nThe options are Gastroenteritis (A), Immunodeficiency (B), Intentional contamination (C), Meningitis (D), or UTI (E). \n\nGastroenteritis usually presents with GI symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, but the stiff neck and altered mental status are more neurological. Immunodeficiency could explain recurrent infections, but the acute presentation here seems more like an active infection. Intentional contamination is unlikely without any evidence of abuse. UTI (E) might explain some symptoms, but the neurological signs like stiff neck and minimal responsiveness are more indicative of meningitis. \n\nThe previous E. coli infection might have been a UTI that led to kidney issues, but the current presentation with hypotension and tachycardia could be sepsis from meningitis. Meningitis caused by E. coli is possible, especially in a child with a history of UTIs, as bacteria can spread to the meninges. The dark urine might be due to dehydration or another issue, but the key here is the meningitis symptoms. So the most likely answer is D, Meningitis.\n</think>\n\nD",

Crystal deposition in the joint space leads to an intense inflammatory reaction that causes severe pain and joint effusion. Gout is most commonly due to lifestyle factors including a diet high in red meat and alcohol. Medications that cause elevated uric acid levels (such as thiazide diuretics) may also play a role. Conditions resulting in high cell turnover and therefore excessive purine release such as hematologic malignancies may also lead to the development of gout. Patients typically present with sudden-onset, severe pain, erythema, and joint effusion. Synovial fluid analysis will reveal an elevated leukocyte count and negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals. Treatment of acute gout is with NSAID medications, colchicine, or steroids depending on presentation and patient-specific factors. Prevention of further attacks is centered around lifestyle changes such as avoidance of red meat and alcohol. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol are also often used for prevention of further episodes.\n\nNeogi discusses the management of acute gout. She comments that, while synovial fluid analysis is the gold standard of diagnosis, many physicians do not routinely perform it, instead relying on clinical judgment to diagnose gout. The differential diagnosis for a gout-like presentation includes pseudogout, septic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, reactive arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nFigure A shows monosodium urate crystals, which appear as negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals under polarized light.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Lyme disease may also presents as a monoarticular arthritis in later stages.

The synovial fluid analysis has 20,000 leukocytes/mm\u00b3 and no organisms. The options are Gout, Lyme arthritis, Pseudogout, Rheumatoid arthritis, or Septic arthritis.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key features of each condition. Gout typically presents with acute monoarthritis, often the big toe, but can affect knees. It's associated with hyperuricemia, which can be triggered by alcohol, especially beer. The synovial fluid in gout would have a high leukocyte count (usually over 50,000, but maybe lower here?), and monosodium urate crystals under polarized light are needle-shaped. The question mentions Figure A, which we can't see, but the options might be inferred from other clues.\n\nPseudogout is similar but involves calcium pyrophosphate crystals, often in the knees. It's also acute, but maybe more common in older adults. The synovial fluid leukocytes are usually lower than in septic arthritis but higher than normal. The crystals are rhomboid and negatively birefringent.\n\nSeptic arthritis has a very high WBC in synovial fluid (like >50,000), and presence of organisms. But here, the fluid shows no organisms, so maybe not septic? Though sometimes cultures take time. The patient's temp is normal, which might argue against septic, but not always.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is chronic, usually polyarticular, and synovial fluid WBC around 2000-20,000. But RA typically has morning stiffness and symmetric involvement. The sudden onset here is more acute, so maybe less likely.\n\nLyme arthritis is due to Borrelia, often with a history of tick exposure or erythema migrans. It's usually a monoarthritis but more insidious onset. The synovial fluid would have a moderate WBC, maybe around 2000-20,000, but no organisms. However, the patient's presentation is sudden and severe, which might not fit Lyme as much.\n\nThe synov",

An insulinoma is a beta cell tumor that secretes insulin.\n\nAn insulinoma is a beta cell tumor of the pancreas. The beta cells normally secrete insulin in response to increased circulating fuel substrate (such as glucose or fat). In the setting of an insulinoma, insulin is pathologically and continuously secreted. This leads to profound, recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia. When a patient presents with hypoglycemia of unclear etiology; a blood glucose level, C-peptide level, and sulfonylurea level should be ordered. An infectious workup may be indicated as sepsis can also cause hypoglycemia. In an insulinoma, patients will be hypoglycemic, have an elevated C-peptide level (as this is a marker of endogenous insulin release), and a negative sulfonylurea level (important to rule out as a sulfonylurea overdose can also cause hypoglycemia in the setting of an elevated C-peptide level). Further workup will involve imaging of the abdomen such as a CT scan or MRI (more accurate) to delineate this insulin-secreting mass.\n\nMathur et al. discuss insulinoma. They note that it is a rare endocrine tumor, and note its association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. They recommend workup for an insulinoma should occur in patients with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia without a clear cause.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alpha cell tumor describes a glucagonoma, which pathologically secretes glucagon leading to profound hyperglycemia, a classic rash termed necrolytic migratory erythema (presents with painful, erythematous papules and plaques), and gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n\nAnswer B: Beta cell destruction describes the pathophysiology of type I diabetes mellitus, which presents in pediatric patients (most commonly) with hyperglycemia, weight loss, polydipsia, and polyuria. Treatment involves the administration of insulin. An initial presentation of type I diabetes may be diabetic ketoacidosis which presents with dehydration, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, Kussmaul respirations, and an anion gap acidosis.\n\nAnswer D: Insulin overdose would present with hypoglycemia, somnolence, confusion, and tremulousness. Note that exogenous insulin administration would not elevate the C-peptide level, which is a marker of endogenous insulin production.\n\nAnswer E: Sulfonylurea overdose would cause hypoglycemia that is often persistent given the long half-life of sulfonylureas. It would also elevate the C-peptide level as these medications increase the endogenous release of insulin. However, the sulfonylurea level was negative in this patient. While iatrogenic use of medications is plausible in this patient who has knowledge of medications (as she is a nurse), her repeat episodes and her workup suggesting against an iatrogenic etiology makes an insulinoma a more likely diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nInsulinomas are beta cell tumors of the pancreas and lead to severe hypoglycemia and an elevated insulin and C-peptide level.",

That makes me think of hypoglycemia because when blood sugar drops, the brain doesn't get enough glucose, leading to neuroglycopenia symptoms like confusion. The fact that eating helps supports that because food would raise her blood sugar.\n\nLooking at the lab results: the serum glucose is 29 mg/dL, which is very low. The C-peptide level is 55 ng/mL, which is elevated. C-peptide is produced in equimolar amounts to insulin, so high C-peptide suggests that her body is making a lot of insulin. Since sulfonylurea level is undetectable, that might be a red herring. Wait, but the mother is on glyburide, which is a sulfonylurea. Maybe the patient accidentally took her mother's glyburide? But the sulfonyurea level was undetectable here. Hmm.\n\nWait, the C-peptide is way above normal. Normal is less than 5, and she's at 55. That suggests excessive insulin production.

High C-peptide supports that because insulin secretion would be high, so C-peptide is a marker. \n\nD) Insulin overdose: If she took too much insulin, that would cause hypoglycemia.

Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI. They recommend testing such as cardiac MRI to assess for previous infarction in the appropriate patient population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating pathologic Q waves (red arrows). Note the deep and wide Q waves; this raises concern for a past ischemic event.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute myocardial infarctions would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG with possible reciprocal depressions. While T wave inversions may be indicative of new or acute ischemia, deep pathologic Q waves without ST elevation are indicative of previous infarction.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia would cause U waves on ECG, which appear as a small, \"second T wave\" after the initial T wave. Note they are not U-shaped despite their name. Management is centered on repletion of potassium and often magnesium as well.\n\nAnswer C: Intermittent torsades de pointes can cause syncope and should be suspected in a patient with syncope in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This patient\u2019s QT interval is not particularly prolonged, and his syncope seems to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Management is centered on cessation of QT-prolonging medications and magnesium administration. Note that while ondansetron does prolong the QT interval, it is unlikely to cause torsades given the patient took it a week ago.\n\nAnswer E: Pulmonary emboli would present on ECG with sinus tachycardia in addition to pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia. Note that the ECG is a nonspecific test for pulmonary emboli, and CT angiography is the preferred confirmatory test for this condition. Syncope is a possible presentation of larger pulmonary emboli (though the patient would also be hemodynamically unstable).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPathologic Q waves are indicative of a previous myocardial infarction.",

The options are acute MI, hypokalemia, intermittent torsades, previous ischemia, or pulmonary embolism. Let's think about each option.\n\nFirst, the patient fainted after standing up suddenly. That could be a vasovagal episode or orthostatic hypotension, but the ECG is the key here. The fact that he used ondansetron is important. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist, used for nausea. But some medications can prolong the QT interval. Torsades de pointes is a polymorphic VT associated with a prolonged QT. Torsades can be caused by drugs like ondansetron, though it's less common. Hypokalemia also prolongs the QT and can lead to arrhythmias. \n\nThe ECG in such cases might show a prolonged QT interval. If the ECG shows a prolonged QT, then hypokalemia or drug-induced QT prolongation (like from ondansetron) could be the issue. Torsades de pointes is a specific arrhythmia that might be intermittent. The question mentions \"intermittent torsades des pointes\" as option C. But torsades usually presents with a characteristic ECG pattern of twisting beats around the isoelectric line. However, if the ECG shows a prolonged QT interval without the arrhythmia, maybe the answer is hypokalemia (B) or drug effect. \n\nAlternatively, acute MI would show ST changes, but the patient's symptoms were brief and he recovered quickly.

With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma.

He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding. This stable patient with a benign exam can undergo a CT scan, which will offer more data than a FAST exam and would be performed regardless of whether a FAST exam was positive or negative given this patient's intoxication and abdominal bruising.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient who has experienced blunt abdominal trauma the most appropriate initial step in a stable patient is an abdominal CT scan.",

He was driving, crashed into a tree at 25 mph, and was disoriented but awake at the scene. His vital signs are mostly within normal limits except maybe the blood pressure is a bit on the higher side, but not critically. He's confused, which might be due to alcohol or drugs since he smells of alcohol and marijuana. The physical exam shows facial and arm lacerations, normal heart and lungs, and an abdomen with bruising but no tenderness, distension, or rigidity.\n\nThe question is about the next step in management. The options are CT scans, chest X-ray, laparoscopy, peritoneal lavage, or a FAST exam.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the approach to trauma patients. The primary survey (ABCs) is done first, but since he's stable now, moving to the secondary survey. Since he's alert enough (opens eyes to voice and follows commands, though confused), maybe he's a GCS of 13 or 14? Wait, GCS: eyes to voice is 3, best verbal (speaking but confused) maybe 4 or 5, motor follows commands is 6. So total around 13-14, which is moderate TBI maybe, but not critical.\n\nThe key here is the mechanism of injury and the abdominal findings. The abdomen has bruising but no tenderness, rigidity, or distension. So maybe a seatbelt sign? But he's not showing peritoneal signs. Since he's alert, maybe a FAST exam would be the first step for abdominal trauma. FAST is quick and can detect free fluid, which might indicate internal bleeding. The options include E) Focused abdominal sonography for trauma.\n\nAlternatively, chest X-ray (B) is often done in trauma patients for things like pneumothorax, hemothorax, or rib fractures. But the lungs are clear, so maybe not urgent. However, the mechanism could involve chest injury even if auscultation is clear. But the question is about the next step. \n\nDiagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is an older method to assess for abdominal bleeding, but it's less commonly used now since FAST is quicker and non-invasive. Laparoscopy (C) is invasive and usually reserved if there's a high suspicion and FAST is equivocal or not available",

Degmacytes (\"bite cells\") will be seen on peripheral blood smears in these patients.\n\nPatients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency will experience hemolytic anemia when exposed to an oxidizing substance such as sulfa drugs or fava beans. Laboratory tests will show a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Since hemolysis releases intracellular enzymes into the bloodstream, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase will be increased. Hemoglobin is then metabolized in the spleen into unconjugated bilirubin, which will cause an elevated bilirubin level that is primarily indirect. In the acute setting, G6PD levels will be normal because the most compromised cells have all been hemolyzed. Obtaining a G6PD level in between episodes of hemolysis is therefore required to observe the chronically decreased G6PD in these patients. A peripheral blood smear will reveal degmacytes (\"bite cells\") and Heinz bodies. Avoidance of oxidative stress to red blood cells is the most important component of management in these patients.\n\nBelfield and Tichy discuss the classic presentation of G6PD deficiency in patients. The authors review oxidizing medications such as rasburicase, primaquine, dapsone, pegloticase, and methylene blue. The authors recommend avoiding initiation of these medications whenever possible until a G6PD diagnostic test has been performed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acanthocytes can be seen in patients with liver disease due to defective production of lipoproteins; however, these cells do not undergo acute hemolytic destruction. Patients with abetalipoproteinemia usually present with symptoms consistent with fat-soluble vitamin deficiency such as bleeding (vitamin K) or osteoporosis (vitamin D).\n\nAnswer B: Codocytes are most commonly seen in patients with thalassemia but can also generally be seen in all microcytic anemias. Patients with thalassemia will present with chronic anemia without acute episodes of hemolysis. The increased lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels in this patient indicate an acute hemolytic event.\n\nAnswer D: Schistocytes can be seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Patients with TTP present with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, neurologic symptoms, and acute kidney injury. DIC is a common downstream pathway for many processes such as sepsis, malignancy, and eclampsia; however, it would present with diffuse clotting and bleeding from all sites.\n\nAnswer E: Spherocytes can be seen in hereditary spherocytosis, which may result in hemolysis during times of acute stress; however, this patient denies symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Instead, the hemolysis in response to new foods is most likely due to exposure to oxidizing substances such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency will experience hemolytic anemia in response to oxidizing substances and will have degmacytes (bite cells) on peripheral blood smear.",

His labs show low hemoglobin, elevated LDH, and low G6PD. The question is about what would be seen on a peripheral blood smear.\n\nFirst, the key points here: He was prescribed an antibiotic (TMP-SMX) and now has symptoms like dark urine and fatigue. The labs indicate anemia (hemoglobin 7.2, which is low), elevated LDH (a sign of hemolysis), and his G6PD level is low (normal is 6-20, his is 7). Wait, actually 7 is just below the normal range? Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Wait, the normal is 6-20, so 7 is just barely low. But G6PD deficiency is an X-linked condition, common in some populations. \n\nDark urine suggests hemoglobinuria from hemolysis. The symptoms started after starting the antibiotic, so drug-induced hemolytic anemia is a possibility. Since G6PD is low, this could be a case of G6PD deficiency where the medication triggered a hemolytic crisis. G6PD deficiency can lead to hemolytic anemia when exposed to certain drugs, fava beans, infections, etc. \n\nNow, the blood smear findings.

Although most infections are asymptomatic, notable characteristics include headache with retro-orbital pain, bone pain (\"break-bone fever\"), leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (< 100,000 /\u00b5L). Symptoms typically develop several days to 2 weeks following the bite of an infected mosquito. The diagnostic test of choice is a serologic antibody test, although PCR can also be used in the acute (< 3 days) phase of illness. Treatment is with supportive care including rehydration.\n\nJasamai et al. present the current treatment options for dengue fever.

They recommend using effective preventive measures such as mosquito control in endemic areas.\n\nFigure A is a clinical photograph demonstrating the maculopapular rash seen in dengue fever.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood culture is used for the detection of bacterial infections of the blood. This patient's IV drug use puts him at risk for bacterial endocarditis, but he does not have other expected findings, such as new murmur, Janeway lesions, Roth spots, or Osler nodes. Endocarditis should be treated with intravenous antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Blood smear is the diagnostic test of choice for other mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria. It is not used in the detection of dengue. Malaria presents with cyclical fevers and organisms on blood smear. It can be treated with chloroquine and artesunate.\n\nAnswer D: Sputum with acid fast stain is the test of choice for tuberculosis. This patient has a risk factor of TB as he recently traveled to Africa, but he does not have any pulmonary symptoms. Treatment for tuberculosis is rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol therapy (among other possible regimens).\n\nAnswer E: Stool culture may be used to diagnose typhoid fever.

The lab results show leukopenia (low WBC at 2400), which can be seen in viral infections or some bacterial infections. The hemoglobin and hematocrit are normal, but the MCV is low (81), which might indicate iron deficiency or maybe something else. The platelets are low (92k), so thrombocytopenia.

Radioiodine ablation is the preferred definitive management for Graves disease, which can worsen exophthalmos.\n\nGraves disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroid disorder caused by antibodies to the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which induce production of T4 and triiodothyronine (T3). Overstimulation of the thyroid gland by TSHR antibodies results in diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, termed \u201cgoiter.\u201d TSHR is also highly expressed in retro-ocular adipocytes and fibroblasts, where overstimulation by TSHR antibodies (and activated T-cells) leads to the expansion of retro-ocular connective tissue and extra-ocular muscle volume. This causes exophthalmos (bulging eyes) and is referred to as Graves ophthalmopathy or orbitopathy. Beta blockers are used to achieve acute sympathetic control in hyperthyroid Graves patients, and antithyroid medications (propylthiouracil or methimazole) are initiated to achieve a euthyroid state. Radioactive iodine ablation is first-line definitive management, particularly, for individuals with unsuccessful anti-thyroid medication management. Radioiodine ablation has been known to increase TSHR-antibodies, likely secondary to the leakage of thyroid antigens, and thus exophthalmos is often worsened after treatment. For this reason, corticosteroids are often co-administrated as a prophylactic measure.\n\nDavies et al. review Graves disease including the pathophysiology and management. They note that Graves orbitopathy may be worsened by radioiodine ablation. They recommend further studies and advancements in care given this lasting complication.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Hair loss can occur in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid states due to altered hair follicle stem cell function. However, this process is typically reversed, not worsened, after achieving a euthyroid state.\n\nAnswer C: Heat intolerance occurs in Graves disease due to hyperthyroid-induced sympathetic overactivity, which resolves after successful treatment.\n\nAnswer D: Menstrual irregularity occurs in hyperthyroidism through altered levels of sex hormone binding globulin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and prolactin. However, treatment of hyperthyroidism typically restores menstrual regularity. After ablation, patients will be hypothyroid; however, the standard of care is to start the patient on levothyroxine which should prevent this complication.\n\nAnswer E: Thyromegaly in Graves disease is caused by diffuse overactivation of the thyroid gland by the TSHR antibodies. Once treated with radioactive iodine (I-131), the thyroid gland gradually shrinks in size. Patients who undergo radioactive iodine ablation will later require life-long thyroxine supplementation due to resulting hypothyroidism.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDefinitive therapy for Graves disease is radioiodine ablation, which leads to increased TSHR antibodies and worsened exophthalmos from overactivation of TSHR-rich retro-ocular adipocytes and fibroblasts.",

She was given atenolol, which is a beta-blocker, and that helped her palpitations. The question is asking which of the options is most likely to remain after definitive treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what condition she has. The symptoms point towards hyperthyroidism. The classic signs are palpitations, tremors, weight loss (though not mentioned here), heat intolerance (she feels too hot), menstrual changes, hair loss, and the physical findings of goiter (thyromegaly) and exophthalmos (bulging eyes) are common in Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune thyroid disorder causing hyperthyroidism.\n\nNow, the options are about what remains after definitive treatment. Definitive treatments for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid medications (like methimazole), radioactive iodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. These treatments aim to reduce thyroid hormone production.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nA) Exophthalmos (eye protrusion): This is a feature of Graves' ophthalmopathy. However, eye symptoms can be independent of thyroid function. Even if the thyroid is treated, the eye issues might not improve as quickly or might persist. So this could remain.\n\nB) Hair loss: Hyperthyroidism can cause hair thinning. Once thyroid function is normalized, hair loss might stop, but existing hair loss might take time to regrow. But maybe it's reversible with treatment.\n\nC) Heat intolerance: This is a symptom of hyperthyroidism. Once treated, the heat intolerance should resolve as metabolism normalizes.\n\nD) Menstrual irregularity: This is due to the hyperthyroid state. Once treated, menstrual cycles should regularize.\n\nE) Thyromegaly (enlarged thyroid): The goiter might reduce in size with treatment, but sometimes it doesn't completely go away.

Tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to unregulated cell growth, leading to the formation of hamartomas in various locations. Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. They found that cardiac rhabdomyomas can lead to arrhythmia later in life. They recommended that infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis be treated with vigabatrin but other seizure types should be treated similar to other epileptic disorders.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Glaucoma may occur in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by \"tram-track\" calcifications in the brain, port-wine stains of the face, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is supported with endocrine tests as well as genetic testing.\n\nAnswer E: Renal cell carcinoma is associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), which presents with tumors arising in multiple organs. Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Diagnosis of VHL is with genetic testing.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTuberous sclerosis has numerous manifestations including seizures, angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, renal angiomyolipoma, ash-leaf spots, mental retardation, and cardiac rhabdomyoma.",

These are often found in infants and can be detected via ultrasound. Glaucoma can occur in neurofibromatosis type 1, which presents with optic gliomas and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots. Optic gliomas are more NF1-related. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is part of McCune-Albright syndrome, which also includes precocious puberty and skin caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (but not hypopigmented). Renal cell carcinoma isn't directly linked here. \n\nSo, the key here is the hypopigmented macules and the plaque, pointing to TSC. The most common associated tumor in TSC is cardiac rhabdomyoma (option A). Glaucoma can occur in TSC too, but it's less common. The other options are linked to different conditions. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nA",

Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the most appropriate next step in a clinical setting. \n\nIsotretinoin (C) is a strong option for severe acne that's resistant to other treatments. Since he's had acne since 13 and it's persistent, maybe his case is moderate to severe. But isotretinoin is usually reserved for when other treatments fail. The question says he's been on the current treatment for a month. Maybe they should try another step first, like adding oral antibiotics (D) to target inflammation and bacteria. Oral antibiotics are often added when topical treatments aren't enough. \n\nTopical antibiotics (E) might already be part of the regimen, but he's on benzoyl peroxide and retinoids. Wait, benzoyl peroxide is antibacterial, so maybe the topical antibiotic isn't yet added. Alternatively, maybe combining with a topical antibiotic like clindamycin.

In the setting of serum hypo-osmolality, urine hyper-osmolality, urine sodium concentration > 20 mEq/L, and hypovolemia (low blood pressure, decreased skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill), this is indicative of cerebral salt wasting.\n\nThe mechanism of cerebral salt wasting is unclear, although some hypotheses point to increased release of brain natriuretic peptide after injury leading to suppression of renal sodium reabsorption, or sympathetic nervous system injury resulting in an impaired renin response. Patients classically present several days after cerebral injury or neurosurgery with hypovolemic hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Water retention results in serum hypo-osmolality, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia with urine hyper-osmolality and increased urine sodium excretion. In patients with prolonged cerebral salt wasting, hypokalemia can also occur (potassium may be normal in acute states). Treatment in mild or moderate cases consists of normal saline infusion to correct both volume status and hyponatremia. Treatment in severe cases consists of hypertonic saline. During correction, serum sodium must be monitored closely to prevent central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nCui et al. describe the differences between syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting. They discuss how volume status serves as the key differentiator between these conditions. They recommend paying closer attention to total body electrolyte balance in understanding these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Addison disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, results in salt wasting due to decreased mineralocorticoid activity. Because of reduced aldosterone release, patients also have hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. In contrast, this patient\u2019s potassium and bicarbonate levels are normal. Treatment is with steroids.\n\nAnswer C: Diuretic overuse is occasionally observed in patients using loop diuretics. Overuse of loop diuretics can cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia. Metabolic alkalosis is commonly seen due to volume contraction. Cerebral salt wasting is more likely in this patient presenting after a recent cerebral injury. Treatment is the cessation of the causative medication.\n\nAnswer D: Primary polydipsia can cause symptomatic hyponatremia. The urine would be maximally diluted (urine osmolality < 100 mEq/L) due to an appropriate physiological response to hyponatremia and excess free water intake. Treatment is cessation of excessive water consumption.\n\nAnswer E: Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) presents with identical findings as cerebral salt wasting with the exception of euvolemia as opposed to hypovolemia. An assessment of volume status is essential to differentiate. This patient has clear signs of hypovolemia. Treatment of SIADH is fluid restriction followed by ADH inhibitors, if needed.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCerebral salt wasting presents with hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hypovolemia in the setting of recent cerebral injury or neurosurgery.",

The patient is a 55-year-old woman who presented with a sudden, severe headache, which is a classic symptom of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The CT scan confirmed the diagnosis, and a CT angiogram found the bleeding source. She underwent surgery. Now, on day 3, she's disoriented and has nausea/vomiting. Her labs show low sodium (120 mEq/L), which is hyponatremia. Let's look at the options.\n\nFirst, the context: SAH can lead to certain complications. The key here is the hyponatremia. The options given are Addison's, cerebral salt wasting (CSW), diuretic overuse, primary polydipsia, and SIADH.\n\nLooking at the lab values: serum osmolality is 265 (low, since normal is around 280-295), and urine osmolality is 340, which is higher than serum. That suggests the kidneys are concentrating urine, so the problem is with too much ADH, leading to water retention. Wait, but let's think again. In SIADH, the urine osmolality is high because the kidneys are retaining water, so the urine is more concentrated than plasma. That's exactly what's here. But wait, the patient is on diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone). Diuretics can cause hyponatremia through different mechanisms. \n\nCerebral salt wasting (CSW) is a condition that can occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage. It's characterized by natriuresis (losing sodium in urine) and volume depletion. The urine sodium would be high (like here, 44), and the patient would be volume depleted. The labs show poor skin turgor and delayed capillary refill, which point to volume depletion. In CSW, the hyponatremia is due to loss of sodium and water, but more sodium than water, leading to low serum sodium. The urine osmolality in CSW would be low because the kidneys are trying to retain water, but in this case, the urine osmolality is higher than serum. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, in SIADH, the urine sodium is typically high (since the kidneys are retaining water, so they excrete more sodium). The urine",

During the consent process, the supervisor should outline the patient's and family's rights, wider educational and societal benefits, potential risks, and ensure that performing the procedure would be consistent with the patient's values and wishes.

Radiographs of the spine will show squaring of vertebrae with vertical or marginal syndesmophytes resulting in a \"bamboo spine\" appearance.

MRI is sensitive in detecting sacroiliac inflammation, which makes this the best modality for early detection of ankylosing spondylitis in young patients. Initial therapy for ankylosing spondylitis includes lifestyle modifications (exercise, smoking cessation, physical therapy) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Therapy for patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs includes tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) and interleukin 17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab).\n\nJung et al. studied whether signs of inflammation on MRI are correlated with bone quality in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

Current guidelines dictate that they may be used in cases that are refractory to initial therapy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDressler syndrome (post-MI pericarditis) presents with chest pain, pericardial friction rub, fever, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG, and should be treated initially with aspirin.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 62-year-old man with chest pain and shortness of breath, which occurred while he was barbecuing. His symptoms include chest pain radiating to the left arm, which is a classic presentation for a cardiac issue like a myocardial infarction (heart attack). His medical history includes obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension\u2014all risk factors for coronary artery disease. He's on insulin, metformin for diabetes, and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, which are for blood pressure (lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, HCTZ a diuretic).\n\nThe initial ECG (Figure A) would be important, but since we can't see it, we have to go by the context. The fact that he was admitted to a step-down unit suggests he had an acute coronary syndrome, maybe an NSTEMI or STEMI. Two days later, he has recurrent chest pain, and another ECG (Figure B) is done. The question is about the next step in management.\n\nThe options are angiography, aspirin, ibuprofen, prednisone, or stenting. Let's think through each. \n\nFirst, the patient already presented with ACS, so he's likely been started on aspirin (as part of standard treatment for MI). The question is about the next step after recurrent pain. Recurrent chest pain two days later could indicate ongoing ischemia, possibly a reoccurring MI or unstable angina. The repeat ECG (Figure B) might show new changes, like ST changes or new infarction signs. \n\nIn acute coronary syndromes, the next steps often involve cardiac catheterization (angiography) to assess for blockages and possibly perform interventions like stenting. Aspirin is part of the initial management, but if he's already on it, maybe he's been given it already. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, which is generally avoided in acute MI because it can increase risk of bleeding and might impair healing. Prednisone is a steroid, which isn't standard here unless there's another issue like pericarditis, but the question doesn't suggest that. Stenting would be done after angiography if a blockage is found. \n\nSo the most appropriate next step after recurrent symptoms and a new ECG would be to do an angiography to evaluate the coronary arteries. The decision to stent would come after seeing the angiogram results. Therefore",

        "reason": "This young patient presents with extensive bruising following an injury, a family history of blood disorder, and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with a normal prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time. These findings suggest a diagnosis of hemophilia A caused by factor 8 deficiency.\n\nHemophilia is a deficiency of factor 8 (hemophilia A) or factor 9 (hemophilia B). Common symptoms of hemophilia include hemarthrosis, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding. Laboratory testing is helpful in confirming the diagnosis, as hemophilia is characterized by an isolated prolongation of PTT without a change in PT. The factors involved in hemophilia participate only in the indirect cascade of coagulation factor activation. Similarly, since bleeding time depends only upon platelet function and not coagulation factors, hemophilia presents with a normal bleeding time. Treatment of hemophilia includes desmopressin in mild cases and factor replacement in moderate to severe disease.\n\nBerntorp et al. present a review of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia. They discuss how these patients now have normal life expectancies with the advent of factor replacement therapy. They recommend being vigilant for the development of anti-factor antibodies.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anti-platelet antibodies are responsible for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This disease is caused by autoimmune antibody formation that damages platelets and causes them to be removed by splenic macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system. It usually occurs in children after an acute viral infection and it presents with bleeding from mucosal surfaces with laboratory findings showing an increased bleeding time, decreased platelets, and a normal PT/PTT.\n\nAnswer C: Factor 9 deficiency (hemophilia B) presents nearly identically to hemophilia A with a normal PT, prolonged PTT, and normal bleeding time with a history of bleeding in male relatives. However, because hemophilia B is epidemiologically less common than hemophilia A, hemophilia A is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer D: GP1b deficiency causes Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by unusually large platelets and a low platelet count. Like von Willebrand disease (vWD), patients often present with cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, abnormal bleeding from minor trauma, and a prolonged bleeding time, which this patient does not have. It can be distinguished from vWD by a ristocetin assay. Treatment can include tranexamic acid.\n\nAnswer E: Von Willebrand factor deficiency results in vWD, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Unlike this patient, patients with vWD also present with a prolonged bleeding time. Patients with vWD will also have an increased PT because this factor is responsible for stabilizing coagulation factor 8.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHemophilia A is caused by factor 8 deficiency and presents with hemarthrosis, frequent bruising, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal bleeding with a prolonged PTT with a normal PT and bleeding time.",

His family history mentions his maternal uncle has similar issues. The lab results show a prolonged PTT of 56 seconds, while the PT and bleeding time are normal. The hemoglobin and other blood counts are within normal ranges.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the different bleeding disorders and their associated lab findings. The key here is the PTT. A prolonged PTT usually points to an issue with the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which includes factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. Since the PT is normal, that rules out extrinsic pathway issues like factor VII deficiency. The bleeding time is normal, so platelet function (like in von Willebrand disease or GP1b deficiency) might not be the main issue here, but I need to check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA) Anti-platelet antibodies: That would affect bleeding time, but BT is normal here. So probably not A.\n\nB) Factor 8 deficiency: That's hemophilia A. Factor VIII is part of the intrinsic pathway, so PTT would be prolonged. Since the PTT is elevated, this is a possibility. But let's check others.\n\nC) Factor 9 deficiency: Hemophilia B, also part of the intrinsic pathway. Same as B in terms of PTT prolongation.\n\nD) GP1b deficiency: This is a platelet disorder, part of Bernard-Soulier syndrome. That would affect bleeding time, which is normal here, so maybe not D.\n\nE) Von Willebrand factor deficiency (VWD): VWD can affect factor VIII levels (since VWF carries it) and also platelet function. The PTT might be prolonged here too. But the bleeding time could be prolonged in VWD, but the patient's BT is normal. Also, the family history is on the mother's side, which might be relevant for X-linked disorders. Wait, hemophilia A (factor VIII) is X-linked, so if the uncle has it, that's possible. VWD is usually autosomal dominant, but can have variable expression. \n\nThe question mentions that the parents deny mucocutaneous bleeding (nosebleeds, gum bleeding), which is more common in VWD. The patient's main issue is bruising, which can occur in hemophilia. Since the PTT is prolonged and PT",

Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding.

The lack of prenatal care might mean some screening wasn't done. \n\nCataracts in a newborn can be due to infections (like congenital rubella, CMV, toxoplasmosis), genetic disorders, or metabolic issues. The hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice point towards a storage disorder maybe? Like Gaucher's disease? Gaucher's is a lysosomal storage disease caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency. It can present with hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal issues, anemia, thrombocytopenia. But cataracts?

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting.

Her current vital signs are mostly normal except for a slightly elevated temperature and respiratory rate on the lower side. She has a history of anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and PCOS but isn't on any meds.\n\nFirst, the key here is the possible overdose. She mentioned acetaminophen, but the family found an empty bottle. Since the bottle was new, maybe she took more than she thought? Acetaminophen toxicity is a concern here. The next steps usually involve checking her acetaminophen levels to assess for possible liver damage.

Activated charcoal is used within 1 hour of ingestion, but it's been 3 hours since they found her, so maybe charcoal isn't effective now.

Pulmonary function testing will typically reveal a decreased FEV1, a decreased FVC, and a decreased FEV1/FVC in both asthma and emphysema. The DLCO will be normal in asthma in contrast to emphysema where the DLCO is decreased. Patients should be treated with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids for acute exacerbations.\n\nPeng et al. review the evidence regarding patients who have COPD versus asthma. They discuss how patients with COPD have reduced DLCO. They recommend measuring parameters to distinguish between these entities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Decreased airway tone does not describe asthma. Rather, hyperreactive airways with increased tone describes an asthma attack. Decreased airway tone may be seen in patients with connective tissue diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nAnswers 2-4: Increased FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FVC do not describe asthma. All of these laboratory values are decreased in asthma and emphysema. Increased respiratory performance can be seen in patients who are athletes or training for marathons.\n\nBullet Summary:\nBoth asthma and emphysema present with a decreased FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC; however, asthma has a normal DLCO while COPD has a reduced DLCO.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with sudden shortness of breath while hiking. She had to take slow deep breaths, which helped. Her vital signs show tachycardia (120 bpm), slightly elevated temperature, and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. The physical exam notes poor air movement bilaterally and tachycardia. The question is about which pulmonary function test parameters (FEV1, FVC, DLCO) best describe her underlying pathology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider possible diagnoses. The sudden onset of shortness of breath with poor air movement could point to asthma, especially since she's a foreign exchange student\u2014maybe an environmental trigger? But the fact that slow deep breaths helped might be a clue. In asthma, rapid shallow breathing can worsen symptoms, so taking slower, deeper breaths might help by keeping airways open longer, preventing collapse. Alternatively, maybe a panic attack? But the physical exam shows poor air movement, which is more objective.\n\nLooking at the options given, the question is about the PFT parameters. Let's recall what each parameter means. FEV1 is the volume exhaled in the first second, FVC is the total exhaled volume. The FEV1/FVC ratio is important. In obstructive diseases like asthma or COPD, the FEV1 is decreased, and the FVC is also decreased but to a lesser extent, so the FEV1/FVC ratio is low. However, in some cases, like when there's a reversible obstruction (asthma), the FEV1/FVC ratio might be preserved or even increased if the obstruction is not severe yet. Wait, no\u2014actually in asthma, during an acute exacerbation, FEV1 and FVC both decrease, but FEV1 decreases more, so FEV1/FVC ratio is low. But maybe in early or mild cases, the ratio might be normal or even increased? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is pointing towards a different condition.\n\nAnother thought: the patient is a young woman with sudden onset, possible anxiety? But the physical exam shows poor air movement, which suggests a true respiratory issue. Alternatively, maybe a foreign body or something else, but that's less likely. Let's think about the options again.\n\nThe options are (A) Decreased airway tone. That might relate to something like COPD or asthma where airways",

This has happened in the past, but his mother thought he was fabricating his symptoms. She has taken him to a free health clinic to have him seen by a doctor who prescribed medication; however, she has been unable to fill the prescription. He has had an MRI of the brain with no acute findings in the past. The mother states this episode lasted about 3 minutes and involved full-body jerking. After the episode, the child was non-responsive but was breathing on his own. The child has a history of migraine headaches with aura that resolve with ibuprofen. He is otherwise healthy and has no medical problems or recent illness and is up to date on his vaccinations. His temperature is 97.6\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/64 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is protecting his airway but is unable to answer questions. He is able to move the right upper and lower extremity. He initially is unable to move his left upper and lower extremity and has a left facial droop; however, after a few minutes, he has 4/5 strength in the affected side with resolution of his facial weakness.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after a seizure (tonic-clonic jerking of his extremities) and is currently postictal given that he is obtunded. Given that the patient is not moving the left side of his body, he is likely suffering from Todd paralysis, which can occur after seizures and resolves on its own with only observation.\n\nA generalized tonic-clonic seizure may present with full-body tonic-clonic activity with altered mental status. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, patients can be postictal and appear to be obtunded. Other than ensuring adequate oxygenation/ventilation and evaluating for the cause of the seizure, there is no further intervention needed as this postictal state will improve with time. After seizures, some patients present with Todd paralysis, which is a focal paralysis after a seizure. This may mimic a stroke, and thus the patient\u2019s risk factors and known seizure history should be factored into the decision. Todd paralysis does not require any intervention and will improve with time and observation only.\n\nXu et al. review Todd paralysis. They note that Todd paralysis is characterized by temporary limb weakness or hemiplegia and usually occurs following a seizure. They recommend that it can be difficult to differentiate Todd paralysis from a stroke in certain patient populations.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnswer A: Alteplase is a thrombolytic that could be used in an acute ischemic stroke if given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset without any contraindications to its use. It would only be given after the CT scan of the head has been performed and other reversible causes have been addressed in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. Alteplase is not given when neurologic symptoms are thought to be secondary to Todd paralysis. In fact, seizure and Todd paralysis would be a contraindication to thrombolytic use in stroke.\n\nAnswer B: CT head, in addition to a fingerstick blood glucose, should immediately be performed in all patients with sudden onset focal neurologic deficits thought to be secondary to a stroke. A stroke would present with sudden onset focal neurologic deficits. However, it is common for patients to be obtunded and have focal neurologic deficits after a seizure and this would not warrant a stroke workup unless clinical suspicion exists. This patient has no risk factors for stroke and his improving strength suggests against a stroke. Moreover, he has a history of a normal MRI of the brain.\n\nAnswer C: Diazepam would only be given for a patient who is actively seizing as it is a benzodiazepine with a long half-life. Note that it is not indicated in a postictal patient as there is no ongoing seizure. Benzodiazepines are not given as preventive measures for seizures.\n\nAnswer E: Sumatriptan may be indicated to treat a migraine, which presents with a pulsatile, unilateral headache and is more common in women. Hemiplegic migraine can cause focal neurologic deficits, and it would be reasonable to treat a migraine headache if a patient had focal neurologic deficits and a history of known hemiplegic migraines. Patients will either have a frequent history of hemiplegic migraines themselves or in their family.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFocal neurologic deficits (Todd paralysis) can be seen after a seizure and will resolve with observation.",

The key points here are the symptoms and the history provided.\n\nFirst, the episodes have occurred before, and there's a history of migraines with aura that respond to ibuprofen. The MRI from the past was normal. The current episode lasted 3 minutes with full-body jerking, then post-ictal non-responsiveness but breathing. Afterward, he had left-sided weakness and facial droop that improved a bit. The mother says this is similar to past episodes.\n\nThe options are Alteplase, CT head, Diazepam, Observation, or Sumatriptan. Let's think through each.\n\nAlteplase is a thrombolytic used for strokes, but it's time-sensitive (usually within 3-4.5 hours). However, the child's symptoms are resolving, and the history suggests recurrent episodes, which might not be a stroke. Plus, the MRI was normal before, so maybe not an acute stroke now.\n\nCT head is often done in suspected strokes or bleeds, but in kids with seizures, sometimes it's considered. However, the MRI was normal before, and the current episode's symptoms are resolving. Also, the fact that the weakness is improving might point away from a stroke, which typically doesn't resolve so quickly unless it's a TIA. But TIAs don't usually have post-ictal states. Hmm.\n\nDiazepam is a benzodiazepine, used to stop seizures. But the episode has already stopped; he's post-ictal. So maybe not needed unless there's ongoing seizure activity. The question says the jerking stopped, so maybe Diazepam isn't the immediate choice here.\n\nObservation: If the episode has resolved and the child is improving, maybe observation is okay. But given the neurological deficits that are resolving, maybe they need to rule out something more serious.\n\nSumatriptan is for migraines. The child has a history of migraines with aura, and the episodes might be related. However, the current episode had motor symptoms and confusion, which could be a migraine variant like a hemiplegic migraine. But the treatment for an acute migraine attack might be different.

In bloody diarrhea, loperamide is contraindicated and could worsen illness.\n\nBacterial diarrhea is commonly caused by organisms such as Campylobacter, Shigella, and Escherichia coli. It may present with bloody or purulent diarrhea and fever and may progress to sepsis or septic shock. Immediate management is centered on hydration. Unstable patients or those who cannot tolerate PO require IV fluids immediately. Otherwise, patients can rehydrate orally. Loperamide is an antimotility agent that decreases diarrheal output. It is contraindicated in bloody diarrhea as it can decrease the rate of fecal shedding and lead to bacteremia and a worsening clinical picture. Loperamide may be appropriate in controlling diarrhea in milder infectious forms of diarrhea, or in non-infectious conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nBaker reviews loperamide. He discusses its indications, contraindications, and mechanism of action. They recommend that loperamide should not be given in invasive diarrhea.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates U waves on ECG (red arrows) that are significant for hypokalemia, which would be expected in a dehydrated patient with profuse diarrhea.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ceftriaxone would be appropriate in this patient who has bacterial diarrhea and appears septic as his critically ill state warrants antibiotics. Note that this patient may receive broader antibiotics than ceftriaxone given how ill he appears. Antibiotics should not be routinely used for bacterial diarrhea in young, healthy patients with stable vitals.\n\nAnswer C: Magnesium could be appropriate in this patient even though his magnesium level is not stated as he is hypokalemic given his ECG is demonstrating U waves. The serum magnesium level does not adequately reflect intracellular magnesium levels. It requires replacement in many cases of hypokalemia.\n\nAnswer D: Norepinephrine could be appropriate in this patient if he remained persistently hypotensive despite fluid administration. Note that this patient could receive more fluids and is not frankly unstable. While norepinephrine may not be appropriate at this time, it is not contraindicated.\n\nAnswer E: Normal saline is generally avoided in diarrheal illness in patients who can tolerate PO as oral hydration is preferred to IV. However, IV fluids are not contraindicated and would be appropriate in this persistently hypotensive patient. Normal saline has a very high sodium and chloride load and can cause a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. For this reason, a lower-chloride solution may be preferred (e.g, Lactated Ringer).\n\nBullet Summary:\nLoperamide is contraindicated in bloody diarrhea.",

The patient has bloody diarrhea, which could be from an infection like E. coli (like EHEC, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and can lead to HUS), Salmonella, Shigella, or maybe C. diff. But given the acute presentation and the bloody diarrhea, E. coli O157:H7 comes to mind. However, the key here is the management.\n\nThe contraindicated treatment: Let's go through the options.\n\nCeftriaxone (A) is an antibiotic. For some diarrheal illnesses, like shigellosis or salmonellosis, antibiotics can be used.

But wait, the question doesn't mention HUS yet, but the presence of bloody diarrhea makes me think of that possibility. So maybe A is contraindicated?\n\nLoperamide (B) is an anti-diarrheal. However, in cases of infectious diarrhea, especially with bloody stools, loperamide is contraindicated because it can worsen the infection by slowing gut motility, allowing more toxin absorption. For example, in C. diff or bacterial infections like E. coli, you don't use loperamide. So B might be the answer here.\n\nMagnesium (C) \u2013 why would that be contraindicated?

Tourette syndrome can be medically treated with antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol.\n\nTourette syndrome presents with multiple motor tics (e.g., grimacing, sniffing) and 1 or more phonic tics (e.g., throat-clearing, barking) that occur for at least 1 year. Tics must begin before the age of 18 years, and their location, frequency, type, complexity, or severity must change over time. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are often co-morbid conditions. Common first-line treatments for Tourette syndrome-related tics include habit reversal training and alpha-2 agonists such as guanfacine or clonidine. However, the only pharmacologic treatments approved for Tourette syndrome in the United States are the antipsychotics haloperidol, pimozide, and aripiprazole. Risperidone is also used due to its favorable side effect profile.\n\nSeideman and Seideman review the current treatments for Tourette syndrome. They note it is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that often occurs in children and presents with motor and phonic tics. They recommend treating with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for optimal care.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that blocks dopamine D2 receptors but is not approved for treatment of Tourette syndrome. It is typically avoided due to the risk for agranulocytosis and is mainly used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia as a last-line agent. Weight gain is another significant side-effect.\n\nAnswer B: Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant commonly used for the treatment of ADHD. ADHD can be comorbid with Tourette syndrome but presents with hyperactivity (e.g., fidgeting, difficulty taking turns, blurting out answers) and/or inattentive symptoms (e.g., daydreaming, difficulty completing tasks) in at least 2 settings. While this patient\u2019s phonic tics are disruptive, he has no difficulty waiting his turn and completing his chores, making Tourette syndrome more likely.\n\nAnswer C: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that may be used for the treatment of OCD. OCD is often co-morbid with Tourette syndrome but compulsions are present, which manifest as repetitive counting, hoarding, tapping, or error checking. This patient\u2019s behavior is better attributed to his tics rather than compulsions.\n\nAnswer E: Methylphenidate is a stimulant used for the treatment of ADHD. ADHD would present with hyperactivity and/or inattentive symptoms. The patient's vocal interruptions are better attributed to his phonic tics.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTourette syndrome is treated with habit reversal training, alpha-2 agonists (e.g., guanfacine, clonidine), and/or antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone).",

On exam, he grimaces and blinks rapidly, but isn't reacting to internal stimuli. His mood and affect are normal.\n\nHmm, the symptoms here sound like tics. The throat-clearing and barking noises are vocal tics, and the grimacing and eye blinking are motor tics. The duration of two years is important because Tourette syndrome typically involves multiple motor and vocal tics lasting more than a year, starting in childhood. But the question is about treatment.\n\nThe options are antipsychotics (clozapine, haloperidol), stimulants (dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate), and an SSRI (fluoxetine). \n\nTourette's tics are often treated with medications if they're severe. First-line treatments for tics can include antipsychotics like haloperidol or pimozide. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic but is usually reserved for more severe cases because of side effects like agranulocytosis. Fluoxetine is an SSRI; I remember that some SSRIs can help with OCD, which sometimes co-occurs with Tourette's, but not sure if it's first-line for tics themselves. Stimulants like methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are typically for ADHD, but they can sometimes worsen tics, so they might not be the best choice here.\n\nThe question mentions that the tics have been present for two years, so it's chronic. Since the main issue here is the tics, the treatment should target that. Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic used for tics. Clozapine is a stronger option but has more side effects.

The options are about next steps in management.\n\nFirst, considering his immunocompromised state (low CD4), opportunistic infections come to mind. The symptoms of nasal congestion progressing to visual issues could point to something like toxoplasmosis, which is common in HIV patients with low CD4 counts.

But the key here is the combination of symptoms and his immunodeficiency.\n\nThe options include empiric treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine, which is the treatment for toxoplasmosis. Dexamethasone is often used alongside antiparasitics for brain lesions to reduce inflammation. A brain biopsy is invasive and usually done if empiric treatment isn't working. Lumbar puncture could help diagnose meningitis, but the MRI might show lesions more indicative of toxoplasmosis. JC virus is associated with PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), but that's typically subacute and might present with different neuro signs. \n\nWait, the patient has IV drug use history, but denies recent use. However, his HIV and low CD4 are more critical. The diplopia could be due to cranial nerve palsy, maybe from a lesion compressing nerves. The MRI in Figure A, which we can't see, but if it shows ring-enhancing lesions, that's classic for toxoplasmosis in this setting. The standard approach in HIV patients with low CD4 and such symptoms is to start empiric treatment for toxo before doing a biopsy, as biopsy is risky.

Cavus occurs when the forefoot is pronated relative to the hindfoot. Adductus occurs when the forefoot is medially deviated compared to the hindfoot. Varus occurs when the heel is medially deviated compared to the ankle. Finally, equinus occurs when the ankle rests in a plantarflexed position.

        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a 2-week-old boy with abnormal feet. The question is about the next step in management. Let me start by recalling what common foot abnormalities are seen in newborns.\n\nFirst, the history: he's a 2-week-old, born at 39 weeks via vaginal delivery. The mom is a first-time mother, 29 years old. He's breastfeeding and has 5 stools a day, which is normal for a breastfed infant. Vital signs are all within normal limits except maybe the temperature is a bit on the higher side but not too concerning. The physical exam shows a benign flow murmur, which is common in infants and usually innocent. The main issue here is the musculoskeletal exam, specifically the feet shown in Figure A. Since I can't see the figure, I need to think about common foot deformities in newborns.\n\nThe options given are Botulinum toxin, reassurance and reassessment, serial casting, surgical pinning, or soft tissue release. Let me think about each option.\n\nCommon foot issues in newborns include metatarsus adductus, clubfoot (talipes equinovarus), and others. Metatarsus adductus is a curvature of the foot, often flexible. Clubfoot is a more severe deformity where the foot is turned inward and downward. The management depends on the type and severity.\n\nMetatarsus adductus is often managed non-surgically. For mild cases, stretching and observation might be enough. Sometimes, serial casting (like the Ponseti method) is used for clubfoot. Botulinum toxin is sometimes used in older children for muscle contractures but probably not in a newborn. Surgical options like pinning or soft tissue release are more invasive and reserved for cases that don't respond to casting or are severe.\n\nSince the baby is only 2 weeks old, the initial approach is usually conservative. For metatarsus adductus, gentle stretching and\u5bbd shoes or splinting might be tried. If it's clubfoot, the Ponseti method with casting is standard. The question mentions \"serial casting\" as option C. Reassurance and follow-up (B) might be okay if it's a mild case that's expected to improve, but given that it's a 2-week-old, early intervention is better. \n\nThe options: if it's metatarsus adductus, serial casting (C) could be an option, but sometimes",

The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis. She does not report symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (joint pain/stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with use).\n\nBullet Summary:\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis is treated with alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate).",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 56-year-old woman presenting with progressive muscle weakness over two weeks, mainly in the lower extremities, along with increased urinary frequency. Her history includes calcium phosphate kidney stones a month ago, rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate, and type 2 diabetes on metformin. \n\nLooking at the labs: her potassium is 2.9 mEq/L, which is low. The HCO3- is 18, which is also low. The other electrolytes are mostly normal except for the chloride being a bit high (106). The anion gap would be Na - (Cl + HCO3) = 137 - (106 +18) = 13. That's within the normal range (usually 8-16), so maybe a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis? But the chloride is high, which can happen in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. \n\nThe key here is the hypokalemia (low K+) and metabolic acidosis (low HCO3). The patient's symptoms of muscle weakness can be due to low potassium. The increased urinary frequency might be related to the kidney stones or the acidosis. \n\nNow, considering her medications: methotrexate can cause renal issues, but she already had nephrolithiasis. Metformin is known to sometimes cause lactic acidosis, especially in renal impairment. Her creatinine is 1.0, which is within normal range (but maybe elevated for her baseline? Not sure). \n\nThe options are: \n\nA) Hydrochlorothiazide: Thiazides can cause hypokalemia because they increase potassium excretion. But she already has low K, so giving a diuretic that lowers K further would be bad. So probably not A.\n\nB) IV insulin: That's used in hyperkalemia to drive K into cells. But her K is low, so this doesn't make sense. So B is out.\n\nC) IV sodium bicarbonate: For metabolic acidosis. But metabolic acidosis here might be due to something else. However, if the acidosis is causing the hypokalemia (since acidosis can cause H+ to move into cells and K to move out, but in this case K is low, so maybe the acidosis is contributing but the K is already low).

Symptoms can usually be managed with lifestyle changes including more frequent, thicker, and lower volume feeds and positioning the patient upright during and after feeding. If symptoms continue, patients should undergo a trial of a dairy-free diet to address possible underlying food protein intolerance.

It presents in the first 8 weeks of life with jaundice, acholic stools, dark urine, hepatomegaly, mild transaminitis, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy.

This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea. Treating the underlying cause in addition to rifaximin will eliminate the excess bacteria.\n\nBullet Summary:\nProton pump inhibitors should be given in patients with persistent diarrhea in the setting of chronic pancreatitis to prevent the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes.",

His history includes alcoholism, multiple hospitalizations for withdrawal, abdominal pain, and traumatic injuries. He hasn't drunk for over a year. Vital signs are mostly normal except maybe the slight temp elevation. The abdomen is non-tender and non-distended. Lab shows low calcium (7.0 mg/dL, which is below normal\u2014normal is around 8.5-10.2 usually). The CT scan isn't described here, but the Sudan Black stain on stool is positive.\n\nHmm, Sudan Black stain is used to detect fat in the stool, so that suggests steatorrhea. Steatorrhea is fatty feces, which can be due to malabsorption. The key here is the patient's history of alcoholism. Chronic alcohol use can lead to pancreatic issues, like chronic pancreatitis. The low calcium might be due to something else, but maybe related? Wait, hypocalcemia in a patient with alcoholism could be from low magnesium (common in alcoholics) leading to hypoparathyroidism, but also chronic pancreatitis can cause fat malabsorption leading to deficiencies. \n\nThe Sudan Black positive stool confirms steatorrhea. So the underlying cause here is likely chronic pancreatitis from his alcoholism, leading to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. That means he can't produce enough pancreatic enzymes to digest fats, so undigested fat ends up in the stool, causing foul-smelling, greasy stools. The treatment for exocrine insufficiency is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. But that's not one of the options here. Wait, the options are Ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic), Loperamide (anti-diarrheal), oral rehydration (for dehydration), Pantoprazole (PPI for acid), and Rifaximin (a non-absorbed antibiotic used for things like traveler's diarrhea or hepatic encephalopathy).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think again. The question is about the underlying cause's treatment. The underlying cause is pancreatic insufficiency from chronic pancreatitis. But the options don't include enzymes. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's another angle. The Sudan Black stain is positive for fat, so steatorrhea. But could there be another cause? Like a bacterial overgrowth?

Other cases may be caused by a parental translocation involving the relevant section of chromosome 5p. Patients present with a mew-like cry, microcephaly, hypertelorism, down slanting palpebral fissures, a broad nasal bridge, low-set ears, low birth weight, hypotonia, and intellectual disability.

The question is asking which chromosome deletion he's most likely to have.

Let's go through each option.\n\nStarting with option B, 5p deletion. That's the cri du chat syndrome. The name \"cri du chat\" means \"cry of the cat\" because babies with this syndrome have a high-pitched, monotonous cry similar to a cat. The physical features include a small head (microcephaly), low birth weight, and facial features like a small chin, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and a round face with a small head. The APGAR scores being low, especially with poor muscle tone, also fits because these babies often have hypotonia. The birth weight at the 5th percentile and the head circumference at the 3rd percentile also align with this syndrome. The temperature and blood pressure might be a bit low, which can be part of the general hypotonia and possibly other issues, but the key here is the facial features and the cry.\n\nOption A is 4p deletion, which is Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. That's characterized by a distinct facial appearance including a broad forehead, prominent glabella, and hypertelorism. The cry is high-pitched but maybe not the classic \"cat-like\" cry. They also have developmental delays and seizures. The facial features here mention a wide nasal bridge and down-slanting palpebral fissures, which might fit, but I think cri du chat is more classic with the 5p deletion.\n\nOption C is 5q. That's associated with conditions like DiGeorge syndrome, but wait, no, DiGeorge is 22q11.2 deletion. 5q might be something else. Maybe the 5q- syndrome in myelodysplasia, but that's an acquired deletion in blood cells, not a congenital syndrome. Not sure if there's a common deletion here for a newborn.

The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a stool ova and parasite assay.\n\nAscaris lumbricoides is a roundworm that is transmitted via the fecal-oral route (egg ingestion). While most patients are asymptomatic, there can be pulmonary and intestinal manifestations in the early and late phases, respectively. Pulmonary signs include dry cough, dyspnea, fever, and wheezing. Intestinal signs include abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, and/or anorexia. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with vague abdominal symptoms with travel history to an endemic area. The diagnosis is secured with stool microscopy for eggs or worms. Complications of this condition include intestinal obstruction or hepatobiliary/pancreatic involvement, presenting as biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, and/or ascending cholangitis. Treatment in patients with uncomplicated infection is with anti-helminth therapy (albendazole or mebendazole).\n\nParija et al. review the epidemiology of helminth infections globally. The authors note that many cases are caused by Ascaris species. They recommend prompt identification of these infections as they can cause lack of school attendance, anemia, and cognitive deficits if left untreated.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bowel wall biopsy is used in the diagnostic work-up of suspected Whipple disease, which presents with chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, and joint symptoms (arthralgias). This disease is progressive over years and would be less likely in this patient with disease onset of 3 months.\n\nAnswer B: CT scan of the abdomen is used in the diagnostic work-up of small bowel obstruction, which presents as crampy abdominal pain, constipation, obstipation, and/or vomiting. Bowel obstruction is an acute process that would be unlikely in this patient with chronic symptoms. Although bowel obstruction is a complication of Ascaris infection, this patient has no signs of obstruction. Diarrhea may occur secondary to infection of the colon as well including colitis or diverticulitis; however, these conditions typically cause pain and low grade fever.\n\nAnswer C: Lower endoscopy (colonoscopy) is used in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, consisting of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis presents with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. Eosinophilia would be unexpected, and this patient does not have bloody diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Stool toxin assay is used to diagnose Clostridioides difficile infection.

The vitamin D is low, but maybe not directly related.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the symptoms and her recent immigration.

A urine chloride test can be used to distinguish between these possibilities because urine chloride will be high in diuretic abuse and will be low/normal in surreptitious vomiting.\n\nMetabolic alkalosis is an acid-base disorder that is due to an increased level of serum bicarbonate. This increase can be secondary to increased bicarbonate intake or loss of hydrogen ions. Etiologies consistent with increased intake include antacid use or milk-alkali syndrome. Etiologies consistent with hydrogen ion loss include gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting or renal losses such as hyperaldosteronism, Bartter syndrome, or diuretic abuse. Urine chloride can distinguish between gastrointestinal and renal losses because urine chloride levels will be high in patients with renal tubule dysfunction or diuretic abuse. This is due to increased urinary excretion of ammonium chloride in cases of diarrhea. On the other hand, urine chloride will generally be low in hyperaldosteronism due to loss of chloride with vomiting.\n\nWu et al. studied the causes of chronic hypokalemia as well as laboratory findings that can be used to distinguish between different etiologies.

The authors recommend the use of the sodium-to-chloride excretion ratio to help diagnose patients with chronic normotensive hypokalemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Arterial blood gas is useful for determining the acid-base state of a patient because it simultaneously measures carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels. This test is not as useful in determining different causes of metabolic alkalosis because all of these etiologies will have similar findings (high bicarbonate and compensatory high carbon dioxide), especially in patient who has already received a venous blood gas.\n\nAnswer B: Complete blood count is useful for determining whether a patient is anemic resulting in decreased oxygen delivery to end organs due to decreased carrying capacity for oxygen. In cases of severe anemia and hypoperfusion, peripheral tissues produce lactic acid which will result in an anion gap metabolic acidosis rather than metabolic alkalosis.\n\nAnswer C: Serum glucose elevation can result in increased diuresis as well as pseudohyponatremia (decreased measured sodium due to increased glucose). Alternatively, acidosis may also be caused by insulin deficiency in diabetic ketoacidosis. Neither of these findings is consistent with the lab results seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer E: Urine toxicology can be used to determine whether the patient is taking any substances of abuse. There is no pathognomonic acid-base finding that can aid in diagnosing overdose and/or substance abuse.

She's on escitalopram for depression.\n\nFirst, looking at the labs: her serum shows Na+ 135 (normal), Cl- 96 (maybe a bit low?), K+ 2.9 (low), HCO3- 36 (high). The venous blood gas pH is 7.52, which is alkalosis. The key here is the lab results and the clinical picture.\n\nThe question is asking which test would help differentiate the etiologies of her lab abnormalities. The main issue here is the metabolic alkalosis (high HCO3-, high pH) along with hypokalemia.

The chloride is 96, which is within the normal range (usually 98-106), but maybe slightly low. In metabolic alkalosis, if chloride is low, it's called chloride-responsive (like from vomiting Cl- poor gastric fluid), whereas if chloride is high, it's chloride-resistant (like from mineralocorticoid excess). Wait, but here the chloride is 96, which is just below normal. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key differentiator between volume depletion (from vomiting) and diuretic use (like thiazides) in metabolic alkalosis is urine chloride. In volume depletion (like from vomiting), the kidneys try to retain chloride, so urine chloride would be low (<20 mEq/L). In diuretic-induced alkalosis (thiazides), urine chloride is higher because the kidneys excrete more chloride.

        "reason": "This child presents with foreign body ingestion with a button battery seen in the esophagus on radiography. The most appropriate next step in management is urgent endoscopic removal of the battery.\n\nButton batteries are commonly used in watches and small electronic devices. If these objects are ingested (usually by children), they can become lodged in the esophagus. Coughing, drooling, and chest discomfort are classic symptoms but a lack of symptoms does not negate the need for evaluation if suspicion is high. The location of the battery can be confirmed by radiograph and orthogonal views can localize the object in the esophagus versus the trachea. Endoscopy is the preferred method of removal as direct visualization of any associated esophageal injury is possible. The battery can cause ulceration or perforation if left in the esophagus due to chemical extravasation.\n\nBaharudin et al. review a number of cases of pediatric ingestions resulting in esophageal lodging. They discuss how a stack of coins can mimic the appearance of a battery. They recommend urgent intervention in cases of suspected battery ingestion.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a chest radiograph depicting a round object lodged in the esophagus, with a \u201cdouble halo\u201d sign (red circle). This sign is an indication that this object is a battery rather than a coin. Figure/Illustration B is a lateral chest radiograph demonstrating that the battery is posterior to the trachea (red circle). This view confirms that the location of the battery is in the esophagus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Balloon catheter removal can be attempted for ingested button batteries but is typically used only if endoscopy is not available. There is more potential for tissue damage without direct visualization, so ingestion time greater than 2 hours is generally a contraindication for this method.\n\nAnswer B: Ipecac administration can induce emesis and is rarely used for toxic ingestions. Vomiting can cause further lodging in the esophagus and even more tissue damage. Ipecac is therefore not recommended in the modern management of toxic ingestions.\n\nAnswer D: Observation would be appropriate if there is an ingested object that has already traveled further into the gastrointestinal tract (if they are small and smooth), as these objects would likely pass on their own. A classic example would be a coin ingestion that would appear as a single round object rather than a double ring appearance. A button battery in the esophagus is an emergency and should be removed urgently.\n\nAnswer E: Surgical extraction of a battery with associated repair may be required if there is suspicion of an esophageal-vascular fistula, mediastinitis, or other such complications. It may also be necessary if a magnet was simultaneously ingested. In the absence of these complications, endoscopic removal should be attempted first.\n\nBullet Summary:\nButton batteries lodged in the esophagus require urgent endoscopic removal.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a 2-year-old boy with a 3-hour history of uncontrollable coughing. His medical history includes obesity and atopic dermatitis, using topical steroids. Family history has asthma and IBS. Vital signs: temp is normal, pulse 120, BP 90/52, respirations 32. He's uncomfortable, coughing a lot, drooling. Chest and abdominal exams are normal. The chest X-ray is shown but we can't see the images. The options are about next steps: balloon catheter removal, endoscopic, ipecac, observation, or surgery.\n\nHmm, the key here is the presentation. The child is coughing a lot and drooling. Drooling in a child with a cough could suggest something blocking the airway. Since he's a toddler, foreign body aspiration is a big concern. The fact that he's drooling might mean that there's an obstruction causing difficulty swallowing saliva. The chest X-ray might show something like a foreign body, but since we can't see it, we have to go by the symptoms.\n\nWait, the options include endoscopic removal and balloon catheter. Those are procedures to remove foreign bodies. Ipecac is for inducing vomiting, but that's not recommended anymore because it can cause more harm, like aspiration. Observation might be if it's not an emergency, but with drooling and coughing, maybe it's urgent. Surgical extraction is more invasive. \n\nSo, if the child has a foreign body in the airway, the standard approach would be bronchoscopy, which is endoscopic. Balloon catheter might be used in some cases, but I think endoscopic removal (like with a bronchoscope) is the standard for airway foreign bodies. The drooling suggests that maybe the object is in the esophagus? Wait, but if it's in the trachea, he'd have more trouble breathing. But the chest X-ray might show if there's a foreign body in the airway. Since the question mentions the chest radiograph, maybe the X-ray shows something like a coin in the esophagus or trachea. \n\nAlternatively, if the foreign body is in the esophagus, endoscopy would be needed. If it's in the trachea, bronchoscopy. Either way, endoscopic removal is the way to go. Ipecac is out because it's not used anymore. Observation",

Riluzole, a glutamate inhibitor, is currently the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication that improves survival in patients with ALS.\n\nALS is a neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons. Upper motor neuron signs include spasticity and hyperreflexia, while lower motor neuron signs include muscle atrophy and fasciculations (spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation). In patients with bulbar-onset ALS, the initial clinical presentation is dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue atrophy, and abnormal jaw jerk reflex. Riluzole decreases the rate of glutamate release from presynaptic neurons, which is thought to decrease excitatory neurotoxicity. Riluzole improves survival by 2-6 months in patients with ALS and may have a greater survival benefit in patients with bulbar-onset ALS.\n\nMasori and Van Damme review the genetics, pathophysiology, classic clinical presentation, extra-motor manifestations, diagnostic workup, and treatment for ALS. They discuss how riluzole provides a survival benefit in patients with this disease. They recommend treating patients with ALS using riluzole as tolerated.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist that reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters to decrease spasticity in ALS. Along with tizanidine, baclofen is a first-line symptomatic treatment for spasticity in ALS. Baclofen does not improve survival in ALS.\n\nAnswer B: Dextromethorphan and quinidine is a combination of a sigma opioid receptor agonist and a sodium channel blocker used to control pseudobulbar affect in patients with ALS. Pseudobulbar affect is a sudden uncontrollable outburst of laughter or tearfulness that affects almost half of patients with ALS. Dextromethorphan and quinidine has not been shown to improve survival in ALS.\n\nAnswer C: Edaravone is an intravenous antioxidant that may decrease the progression of early ALS. Although it is now FDA approved, studies have not yet shown that edaravone improves survival in patients with ALS. Further studies will be needed in order to determine the risks and benefits of using this drug.\n\nAnswer E: Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist that decreases spasticity in ALS by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. Excess spasticity in ALS can negatively impact coordination, ambulation, and other activities of daily living. Tizanidine and other antispastic medications do not improve survival in patients with ALS.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRiluzole is a glutamate inhibitor that improves survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

The physical exam shows he can't fully extend his tongue, there are fasciculations on the tongue, and when tapping the mandible, the lower jaw moves upward a lot. No sensory deficits.\n\nHmm, the key symptoms here are the dysphagia (trouble swallowing), dysarthria (slurred speech), fasciculations (which are muscle twitches), and the jaw movement finding. The absence of sensory issues points away from a sensory neuropathy. The fasciculations and tongue involvement make me think of a motor neuron disease. \n\nThe physical exam findings: inability to extend the tongue fully could be a sign of tongue weakness. Fasciculations in the tongue are a classic sign of lower motor neuron involvement. The jaw jerk hyperreflexia (the pronounced upward movement of the lower jaw when tapping the mandible) suggests upper motor neuron involvement. So combining upper and lower motor neuron signs points towards amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a motor neuron disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons.\n\nNow, the question is about which therapy improves survival. The options are Baclofen, Dextromethorphan/quinidine, Edaravone, Riluzole, and Tizanidine. \n\nI remember that Riluzole is an approved medication for ALS. It's been shown to modestly extend survival. Edaravone is another one that's used; I think it might slow functional decline but maybe not survival as much? Wait, the question specifically asks about improving survival. \n\nLet me recall: Riluzole is the first-line drug, and studies showed it can extend survival by a few months. Edaravone is more about slowing the progression but maybe not survival. The others like Baclofen and Tizanidine are muscle relaxants, which would help with spasticity but not survival. Dextromethorphan with quinidine is used for pseudobulbar affect (emotional lability, laughing/crying episodes), which can occur in ALS, but again, not for survival.\n\nSo the correct answer should be Riluzole (D) or Edaravone (C)?

A Horner syndrome can also be observed with compression of the sympathetic chain leading to ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis in some cases. These malignancies typically occur in older male smokers and can be associated with symptoms such as fatigue, cough, and weight loss.

His medical history includes diabetes, heavy alcohol use, smoking two packs a day since 25, and anabolic steroid use. He's also lost 17 pounds in a month. Vital signs show hypertension, and the physical exam reveals decreased sensation and 2/5 strength in the right arm, with normal left arm strength.

The options given are apical lung tumor, brachial plexopathy, cerebral infarction, scalenus anticus syndrome, and subclavian steal syndrome.\n\nStarting with cerebral infarction (C): Since the weakness is unilateral and there's a history of hypertension (a risk factor for stroke), this could be a possibility. However, the symptoms have been progressive over weeks, which is less typical for a stroke, which usually has an abrupt onset. Also, the pain and sensory changes might not fit a typical stroke presentation. Plus, the lack of change with head/neck position suggests it's not a cervical issue, but cerebral infarction is more about the brain itself. Maybe not the best fit.\n\nApical lung tumor (A): These can compress the brachial plexus, leading to shoulder pain and arm weakness. The patient's history of heavy smoking (a risk factor for lung cancer) and weight loss (a red flag for malignancy) make this a consideration. The symptoms could be due to a Pancoast tumor, which affects the apical lung and can cause pain, weakness, and sensory deficits in the arm. The weight loss and smoking history support this.\n\nBrachial plexopathy (B): This involves damage to the brachial plexus, which can be from trauma, compression, or inflammation. The patient uses anabolic steroids, which are known to cause brachial plexus neuropathy, especially in bodybuilders. The chronic nature of symptoms (weeks) and the presence of pain and sensory loss align with this. Also, steroid use is a direct risk factor here.

The evaluation depends in large part on the age of the patient and whether the patient presents with alarm symptoms such as weight loss, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or iron-deficiency anemia. If the patient is over the age of 50, has alarm symptoms, or has a family history of colorectal cancer, the evaluation should begin with a colonoscopy to rule out malignancy. If the patient is between the ages of 40 and 50 and without other red flags, the patient can elect to undergo sigmoidoscopy as a less invasive procedure than colonoscopy. If the patient is under the age of 40 and without alarm symptoms, the workup may begin with an anoscopy to first evaluate for hemorrhoids. Once cancer has been ruled out, additional evaluation for chronic inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis can be conducted.\n\nChurch presents evidence regarding the current use of colonoscopy.

He recommends understanding which patients are missed and how to better detect neoplasias in these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal CT might be used to evaluate for metastases if the diagnosis of colorectal cancer is confirmed but it would not be used to diagnose the primary malignancy. A CT scan would be the most appropriate initial step in diagnosis if diffuse metastasis were already suspected such as a presentation of severe weight loss and an enlarged, palpable, and nodular liver.\n\nAnswer B: Anoscopy is used for the evaluation of hemorrhoids in a patient < 40 years of age who presents with bright red blood per rectum in the absence of alarm symptoms. It would not be the most appropriate next step for a patient who presents with unexplained weight loss as it cannot be used to diagnose colorectal cancer.\n\nAnswer C: Barium enema is sometimes used to screen for colorectal cancer in conjunction with other tests in asymptomatic patients, but it would not be used to diagnose malignancy in a patient with alarm symptoms such as hematochezia and unexpected weight loss.\n\nAnswer E: Ultrasound of the abdomen would be effective in diagnosing conditions such as intraperitoneal bleeding and cholecystitis. There is no evidence of abdominal trauma that would suggest intraperitoneal bleeding in this patient. A positive ultrasound with free fluid would be treated with diagnostic laparoscopy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIf a patient is over the age of 50 or has alarm symptoms of weight loss, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or iron-deficiency anemia, the patient should undergo a colonoscopy to rule out colorectal cancer.",

He also has unexplained weight loss over two months. His history includes pancreatitis, drinks a bit on weekends, no smoking, and no family colon cancer. The question is about the next best step.\n\nFirst, the key symptoms here are rectal bleeding and weight loss. Bright red blood usually suggests lower GI bleeding, like hemorrhoids or anal fissures. But the weight loss is concerning because that's not typical for those conditions. The patient also mentions no pain or change in bowel habits, which might lean away from something like inflammatory bowel disease, but the weight loss is a red flag.\n\nHis history of pancreatitis might be a distractor. Pancreatitis can be related to alcohol, but he only drinks 2-3 beers on weekends, which might not be heavy. However, the weight loss and bleeding need to be addressed. The options are CT, anoscopy, barium enema, colonoscopy, or ultrasound.\n\nAnoscopy (B) is good for checking the rectum and anus, like hemorrhoids or fissures. But since there's weight loss, which is a warning sign for colorectal cancer, maybe a more thorough exam is needed. Colonoscopy (D) would allow visualization of the entire colon, which is important for someone with occult blood and weight loss even if he's under 50. The average age for colon cancer is around 60-70, but weight loss at 41 is a big concern. The lack of family history might make it less likely, but not impossible. Guidelines recommend considering colonoscopy in anyone with alarm symptoms like weight loss, anemia, or change in bowel habits, even under 50.\n\nBarium enema (C) is an older test and not as good for detecting polyps or early cancers as colonoscopy.

Klinefelter syndrome is usually caused by meiotic nondisjunction that results in a 47,XXY genotype.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is the most common cause of primary hypogonadism. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome present with tall stature, neurocognitive difficulties (ADHD), and features of hypogonadism including gynecomastia, small testes, small phallus, hypospadias, underdeveloped secondary sex characteristics, and cryptorchidism. Patients without hypospadias or cryptorchidism are often not diagnosed until after puberty when the symptoms of gynecomastia and small testes become more prominent. Because the hypogonadism in Klinefelter syndrome is caused by testicular fibrosis, laboratory results demonstrate low testosterone and elevated FSH and LH levels. Treatment for this condition includes androgen replacement therapy.\n\nLanfranco et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of Klinefelter syndrome. They discuss how modern fertility augmentation therapy has allowed some of these patients to produce viable offspring. They recommend having a detailed discussion with these patients and their partners regarding possible outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anabolic steroid use causes decreased levels of FSH and LH due to the suppression of GnRH release by the hypothalamus. This results in decreased FSH and LH release by the pituitary gland. Anabolic steroid use would not present with signs of hypogonadism.\n\nAnswer B: The CGG trinucleotide repeat disorder characterizes fragile X syndrome. Fragile X presents with macroorchidism rather than hypogonadism and patients typically have dysmorphic features of a long, narrow face with large ears, a prominent forehead, and a prominent chin. Fragile X is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability.\n\nAnswer C: The CTG trinucleotide repeat disorder characterizes myotonic dystrophy. Although myotonic dystrophy presents with hypogonadism, patients would also present with symptoms of progressive weakness, such as facial weakness, dysphagia, or hand grip weakness. Treatment is with cardiac pacemakers and ventilatory support.\n\nAnswer D: Failure of neuronal migration characterizes Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome presents with the classic symptoms of anosmia and hypogonadism, but patients with Kallmann syndrome have a low FSH and LH.

His physical exam shows tall stature, mild gynecomastia, sparse facial hair, moderate pubic hair, but small, firm testes. The lab results are FSH 42 and LH 38, both elevated.\n\nHmm, high FSH and LH usually point to primary hypogonadism because the pituitary is trying to stimulate the testes which aren't responding. So the testes aren't producing enough testosterone, leading to elevated gonadotropins. The physical findings like small testes and gynecomastia fit with low testosterone. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA) Anabolic steroid use can cause hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (low FSH/LH) because steroids suppress the HPG axis. But here FSH and LH are high, so that's not it. \n\nB) CGG trinucleotide repeat disorder. That's like Fragile X syndrome, but Fragile X is more about intellectual disability and autism.

This can lead to hyperlipidemia (due to loss of lipoproteins), hypercoagulable state (due to loss of antithrombin III and protein C/S), and hypoalbuminemia. Most serum calcium is bound to albumin, so when albumin is lost in the urine, it can lead to profound hypocalcemia. The ionized or free portion of calcium remains the same; therefore, these patients do not exhibit symptoms of hypocalcemia. Furthermore, the loss of albumin will reduce the oncotic pressure in the vessels resulting in massive extravasation of fluid and anasarca.\n\nAmbler et al. report a case of a patient who presented with a DVT and was found to have nephrotic syndrome. They discuss how the patient had asymptomatic changes in lab values including calcium. They recommend performing a urine dipstick for protein in cases of suspected nephrotic syndrome.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Antithrombin III deficiency is a common cause of a hypercoagulable state because antithrombin III normally helps to neutralize coagulation factors. This disease is a possible explanation for this patient's DVT as it predisposes patients to thrombotic events; however, it does not explain her profound hypocalcemia. Asymptomatic antithrombin III deficiency does not need to be treated; however, patients should have anticoagulation if they undergo surgery.\n\nAnswer B: Factor V Leiden is the most common cause of a hypercoagulable state because this mutation renders factor V unable to be inactivated by proteins C and S. This is a possible explanation for this patient's DVT; however, it does not explain her hypocalcemia. Asymptomatic factor V Leiden mutation does not need to be treated; however, patients should have anticoagulation if they undergo surgery.\n\nAnswer D: Liver dysfunction is possible given this patient's history of alcohol use and IV drug abuse, placing her at risk for chronic hepatitis C infection. Despite the anasarca, this patient has no other stigmata of liver failure such as jaundice or ascites, making nephrotic syndrome more likely.\n\nAnswer E: Prothrombin gene mutation could explain this patient's hypercoagulable state because high levels of this gene can result in unprovoked thrombotic events. This disease would not explain why the patient has anasarca or hypocalcemia.

The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia.

Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole).

Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen.

Although S. aureus is the most common overall cause of osteomyelitis, this patient with a recent animal bite most likely has Pasteurella infection and this organism should be covered accordingly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with suspicion of Pasteurella osteomyelitis infection after an animal bite should be treated with empiric IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a 5-year-old girl with difficulty walking and leg pain. The key points here are the cat bite a week ago, the ongoing pain, and now the MRI showing osteomyelitis. The parents thought the pain was from the healing bite, but now it's worse.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what causes osteomyelitis, especially in a child with a cat bite. Cat bites can introduce bacteria into the wound. Common pathogens from animal bites include Pasteurella multocida, which is a gram-negative rod. But also, other bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Streptococcus species can be involved. Since the wound is on the thigh and leading to osteomyelitis, the infection has likely spread to the bone.\n\nThe question is about the next step in management. The options are antibiotics: A is amoxicillin/clavulanate, B is ampicillin/sulbactam, C doxycycline, D flucanozole (an antifungal), and E vancomycin.\n\nOsteomyelitis treatment depends on the suspected pathogen. For cat bites, the main concern is Pasteurella, but also Staph and Strep. Since it's osteomyelitis, which is a serious infection, we need to cover the likely organisms. \n\nAmoxicillin-clavulanate (A) covers both gram-positive (like Staph and Strep) and some gram-negative (like Pasteurella). Clavulanate is a beta-lactamase inhibitor, so it helps against beta-lactamase producing bacteria. That's a good option. \n\nAmpicillin-sulbactam (B) is similar but ampicillin is more for gram-positive and some gram-negative. Sulbactam also adds beta-lactamase coverage. However, ampicillin might not cover MRSA, but the question doesn't mention MRSA specifically. \n\nDoxycycline (C) is a tetracycline, which covers some gram-negative and anaerobes, but not as good for Staph. Since osteomyelitis often needs coverage for Staph, doxycycline alone might not be sufficient. \n\nFlucanozole (D) is antifungal, so probably not needed here unless there's a fungal infection, which isn't indicated here. \n\nVancomycin (E",

These myoclonic jerks usually have an onset occurring in early adolescence in otherwise healthy children. Myoclonic jerks are most frequently seen right after waking from sleep, but they may also be triggered by lack of sleep, stress, or alcohol consumption. Patients with this disease rarely have associated symptoms but may occasionally also experience absence seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The diagnosis can be secured with a history of seizures alongside an interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) that shows 4 to 6 Hz bilateral polyspikes. Valproate is the first-line treatment.\n\nJohannessen et al. discuss the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. They find that standard antiepileptic treatment with agents such as valproate leads to only 33% of patients remaining seizure-free. They recommend trials of alternative antiepileptic medications such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and topiramate in patients that do not respond to valproate.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Absence seizures commonly present during childhood in otherwise healthy children; however, these seizures are typically characterized by short episodes of loss of awareness known as \"staring spells\" without physical manifestations.\n\nAnswer B: Alcohol intoxication is a risk factor for precipitating juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, but alcohol use does not cause this condition. Seizure activity may also occur during alcohol withdrawal, but the timing of this patient's symptoms is more suggestive of seizure symptoms. Alcohol withdrawal requires chronic drinking of large amounts leading to an increase in central nervous system N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and a decrease in CNS gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. When alcohol cessation occurs, seizures ensue.\n\nAnswer C: Cannabinoid use is not associated with seizure activity either during intoxication or withdrawal.

The spasms happen when he's getting ready in the morning and after staying up late studying. He also mentioned using alcohol and marijuana recently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible causes listed in the options. Let's go through each one.\n\nOption A: Absence seizures. These typically present with brief lapses in consciousness, often with staring spells, but not usually with jerking movements. They also occur more frequently during childhood, but the description here mentions jerking motions, which might not fit absence seizures as well.\n\nOption B: Alcohol intoxication. Withdrawal could cause tremors, but the question mentions the spasms occur after waking up and when he's cramming for exams. If he's using alcohol, maybe the withdrawal from not drinking in the morning? But the timing isn't clear. Also, the question states he's using both alcohol and marijuana, so maybe it's more related to one of those substances. But alcohol withdrawal usually has more systemic symptoms like nausea, sweating, etc., which aren't mentioned here.\n\nOption C: Cannabinoid use. Marijuana can cause some tremors or anxiety, but I'm not sure if it's a common cause of myoclonic jerks. Maybe acute intoxication could lead to some muscle twitching, but the question says the spasms have been going on for two months. If he's been using marijuana for that time, maybe, but the question says he \"recently started\" experimenting. So maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption D: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). This is a type of epilepsy that starts in adolescence. The classic presentation includes myoclonic jerks in the morning, often after waking, which matches the patient's description. The spasms are jerking motions that stop after a few minutes. Also, JME can be exacerbated by sleep deprivation, which aligns with the fact that the spasms happen when he stays up late. Additionally, JME is often genetic, but the patient has no medical history, so maybe it's newly presenting. The absence of other symptoms and normal physical exam also fit, as JME doesn't usually have other neurological signs unless there's a seizure.\n\nOption E: West syndrome. This is an infantile epileptic disorder with spasms, usually in infants under 1 year, characterized by \"jackknife\" seizures",

The physical exam shows some blood in the rectal exam and mentions a finding in Figure A, which I can't see, but maybe it's relevant.\n\nFirst, the key symptoms here are vomiting, regurgitation, and blood in stools. The blood in the stool could be from different causes.

But the question is about the next step in management.\n\nThe options are PPI, modifying the mother's diet, ultrasound, reassurance, or switching to hydrolyzed formula. Let's think through each.\n\nProton pump inhibitors (PPI) are used for acid-related issues like GERD. But in infants, GER is common, but the blood in stool might not be from that. Also, PPIs aren't first-line for infants with blood in stool. \n\nModifying the mother's diet: If the baby has a milk protein allergy, the mother might eliminate allergens like dairy. But would that be the next step? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the top choice here.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound could check for structural issues like intestinal obstruction, malrotation, or other anatomical problems. Since the abdomen is soft and non-tender, maybe not an emergency, but the blood in stool and vomiting could indicate something like malrotation with midgut volvulus, which is a surgical emergency. But the question says the patient is well-appearing, so maybe not. Alternatively, Hirschsprung's disease can present with constipation and blood in stool, but the baby isn't in distress. An ultrasound can help check for those.\n\nReassurance might be if it's a benign condition like physiologic reflux, but the blood in stool complicates that. \n\nSwitching to hydrolyzed formula: This is for milk protein allergy.

The appropriate treatment for this is supportive care with return precautions (instructing the mother to bring the child back to a physician if he becomes short of breath).\n\nViral pharyngitis in children is most often caused by adenovirus, though other viruses can cause the condition as well. The diagnosis is clinical, with a presentation of fever, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, sore throat, and cough. Features that can help distinguish viral pharyngitis from pneumonia include a lack of tachypnea, increased work of breathing, hypoxemia, or adventitial lung sounds. No additional testing or intervention is necessary. The illness is typically self-limited and resolves with supportive care.\n\nShapiro et al. study features predictive of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in children. The authors found that among patients with features of viral illness, patients older than 11 years of age who did not have a fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, or tonsillar exudates were at the lowest risk for GAS. The authors recommend against testing low-risk children for GAS to avoid antibiotic treatment in patients merely colonized with GAS.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering antitoxin and toxoid vaccine is the treatment for Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection. Although this child has not received his age-appropriate vaccinations, his presentation is not concerning for infection with diphtheria. C. diphtheriae infection presents with cervical lymphadenopathy and gray pseudomembranes on pharyngeal exam, neither of which this child has.\n\nAnswer B: Amoxicillin should be given in cases of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis. Before amoxicillin is prescribed, testing with Streptococcal rapid antigen detection testing should be performed. Additionally, rapid antigen detection testing is not indicated in this patient as she has a cough and does not have cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar exudates, or palatal petechiae. All of these findings are not typical of GAS pharyngitis.\n\nAnswer C: Influenza testing and oseltamivir are indicated if the child had myalgias or high fevers that would make influenza more likely and if he presented within 2 days of symptom onset. Oseltamivir is only approved for treating influenza in uncomplicated cases if started within this 2-day window from symptom onset. Exceptions to this 2-day guideline include adults greater than 65 years of age, pregnant women, residents of long-term care facilities, American Indians, persons with BMI greater than 40 kg/m^2, and those receiving immunosuppressive medications.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a chest radiograph and respiratory virus panel can be done when a lower respiratory infection such as bacterial pneumonia is expected. However, viral infections are much more common than bacterial pneumonia in this age group. Additionally, this patient is not tachypneic, does not have evidence of increased work of breathing, and is not hypoxemic, all of which make bacterial pneumonia less likely.\n\nBullet Summary:\nViral pharyngitis in children is a clinical diagnosis consisting of fever, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, cough, sore throat, and pharyngeal erythema, and is treated with supportive care.",

Antitoxin is used for diphtheria. Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. The symptoms of diphtheria include sore throat, fever, and a gray membrane over the tonsils, which can lead to airway obstruction. But the exam here mentions redness on and around the tonsils, not a membrane. Also, the presence of conjunctivitis might not be classic for diphtheria. Hmm, but maybe the parent's refusal of vaccines makes diphtheria a consideration. However, diphtheria is rare in vaccinated populations, but since he's unvaccinated, maybe it's a possibility.

Given the bedside echocardiograph that is notable for a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with septal bowing into a hyperkinetic left ventricle, the most likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism that is causing obstructive shock.\n\nPulmonary embolism is most commonly caused by a deep vein thrombosis in the veins of the lower extremity that travels to the pulmonary circulation. Patients will present with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, sinus tachycardia, and hemoptysis. Massive pulmonary emboli can cause hemodynamic instability. Patients may become hypotensive, tachycardic, and ultimately pulseless. The pulmonary embolism can obstruct blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, leading to a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with septal bowing and a hyperdynamic left ventricle. This is a type of obstructive shock. Treatment of a massive pulmonary embolism causing hemodynamic instability may involve thrombolytics or thrombectomy.\n\nStandl et al. review obstructive shock. They note that obstructive shock is caused by an obstruction of blood flow out of (or in the case of tamponade, into) the heart. They recommend that treating the underlying cause is the only effective management option.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiogenic shock is caused by cardiac dysfunction in conditions such as myocardial infarction or heart failure. Cardiac dysfunction then leads to impaired systemic perfusion. Initial management includes treating the underlying cause (e.g., cardiac catheterization for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) to maintain the patient\u2019s blood pressure.\n\nAnswer B: Hemorrhagic shock is a common cause of shock in trauma and presents with hypotension and tachycardia secondary to blood loss. A narrowed pulse pressure may be the first sign of hemorrhagic shock. The mainstay of management is blood transfusion and an intervention to stop the bleeding.\n\nAnswer C: Neurogenic shock occurs when there is central nervous system trauma (often to the cervical spine) leading to decreased sympathetic tone systemically. Patients will present with hypotension and bradycardia (contrast with tachycardia in hemorrhagic shock), and management is centered on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and neurosurgical intervention for the underlying etiology. IV fluids can also be given to maintain blood pressure.\n\nAnswer E: Septic shock occurs when a systemic infection leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction with hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation. The mainstay of management includes fluids, blood cultures, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Early administration of antibiotics improves outcomes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPulmonary embolism is a common cause of obstructive shock.",

She has a history of being obese, on oral contraceptives, recent Achilles tendon surgery, and occasional smoking. After CPR and epinephrine, she regained her pulse. The key finding here is the bedside echocardiogram showing a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with septal bowing into a hyperkinetic left ventricle.\n\nHmm, right ventricular issues often point towards a pulmonary embolism. The echocardiogram findings are classic for acute pulmonary embolism. The right ventricle is dilated and not contracting well, while the left side is hyperkinetic. The septum bowing towards the left suggests pressure difference. \n\nLooking at her risk factors: recent surgery (Achilles tendon repair) increases DVT risk, which can lead to PE. Oral contraceptives also add to the hypercoagulable state. She's obese, another risk factor. PEA is a common presentation in massive PE. \n\nNow, the options: Obstructive shock (D) is when something is physically blocking the heart's ability to pump, like tamponade or PE. Cardiogenic (A) is from heart failure, but the RV findings here are more specific. Hemorrhagic (B) is blood loss, but there's no mention of trauma. Neurogenic (C) is from spinal injury, which she doesn't have. Septic (E) would have fever, hypotension, but the echo findings don't fit sepsis. \n\nSo the most likely is obstructive shock due to PE.

They discuss no specific form of psychotherapy is superior to others. They recommend starting any form of psychotherapy for these patients to improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Antisocial personality disorder presents with aggressive, criminal behavior. These individuals do not conform to social norms or rules and violate the rights of others. Patients often are not amenable to behavioral modification and therefore incarceration may be necessary in order to protect the rights of others.\n\nAnswer B: Avoidant personality disorder presents with excessive shyness and hypersensitivity to rejection. These patients fear social interaction though they strongly desire relationships. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be used in order to encourage these patients to be more open to seeking out relationships.\n\nAnswer D: Dependent personality disorder presents with submissive and clingy behavior. They often have a need to be cared for and will be very agreeable and dependent on others. This can be harmful as patients may stay in abusive or degrading relationships due to a fear of being alone. Treatment is with cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nAnswer E: Histrionic personality disorder presents with colorful and exaggerated attention-seeking behavior. These patients will often employ sexuality to draw attention to themselves. Though this patient is displaying her breasts and wearing seductive clothing, her history of self-harm behavior and unstable relationships suggests a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.\n\nBullet Summary:\nBorderline personality disorder presents with emotional instability, unstable relationships, and self-harming behavior.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 23-year-old woman who came to the ER with a self-inflicted laceration on her forearm. She mentions that she knew her boyfriend was having sexual thoughts about someone else, which led her to cut herself. She's been here before for similar reasons related to online dating. Now, she's tearful, apologizing, and regrets her actions. The key points here are her history of self-harm in the context of relationship issues, her fear of abandonment or rejection, and her intense emotional reactions.\n\nThe options are Antisocial, Avoidant, Borderline, Dependent, and Histrionic. Let's go through each. \n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder is characterized by disregard for others' rights, deceitfulness, impulsivity, and aggression. But the patient here is apologizing and seems remorseful, which doesn't fit antisocial's lack of guilt. Plus, she's not showing deceit or ongoing criminal behavior.\n\nAvoidant Personality Disorder involves feelings of inadequacy, social inhibition, and hypersensitivity to criticism. The patient here is in relationships but struggles with them, but the self-harm due to perceived infidelity might not align as much with avoidant traits. She's not avoiding relationships entirely, just having trouble maintaining them.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a strong candidate. Key features include fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, impulsivity (like self-harm), emotional instability, and chronic feelings of emptiness. The patient's reaction to her boyfriend's perceived infidelity leading to self-harm, her history of similar episodes with online dating, and her intense emotional responses (getting furious when told to stay in the psych ED) all point to BPD. The instability in relationships and the self-injurious behavior are classic.\n\nDependent Personality Disorder is about needing excessive support, fear of separation, and submissive behavior. The patient here seems more conflicted in relationships rather than overly dependent. She's acting out due to fear of abandonment, but that's more BPD.\n\nHistrionic is about excessive emotion and attention-seeking. The patient's dress is revealing, which might hint at that, but the core issue here is the self-harm in response to relationship stress. Histrionic might involve more manipulative attention-seeking, but the key symptoms here align more with BPD's pattern of unstable relationships and self-harm.\n\nSo putting it all together, the most likely is Borderline Personality Disorder, option C.\n</think>",

The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient\u2019s nutritional requirements. She reports that about 2 weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. He seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. His mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient\u2019s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 72/49 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 32/min.

The most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and counseling on proper positioning.\n\nPhysiologic or uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux usually presents in patients in the first few months of life with frequent regurgitation or vomiting, sustained appetite after regurgitation, and minimal irritability. The most appropriate first step in management is reassurance and counseling parents to position patients upright for 20-30 minutes after feeding. For patients with persistent symptoms, parents should be encouraged to provide lower volume feeds more frequently throughout the day, and consider a milk-free diet to address possible underlying cow\u2019s milk allergy. Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor is reserved for intractable cases. For most patients, gastroesophageal reflux self-resolves by 1 year of age.\n\nChabra and Peeples review the evidence regarding the treatment of neonatal GERD.

This patient has uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux without any signs of feeding refusal, worsening irritability, or nutritional compromise.\n\nAnswer B: Obtaining an abdominal ultrasound would evaluate for pyloric stenosis, which presents with non-bilious, projectile vomiting rather than the regurgitation that this patient\u2019s mother is describing. An abdominal ultrasound would be the appropriate next step in management for patients who present with a description of more forceful vomiting or have a classic \u201colive-shaped\u201d mass in the epigastrium on physical exam.\n\nAnswer D: Recommending modification of the mother\u2019s diet would be appropriate if this patient had more severe symptoms that were refractory to lifestyle changes. It would also be appropriate if the patient had signs of an underlying allergy to cow\u2019s milk or soy protein, such as blood-streaked stools.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to a hydrolyzed formula would be appropriate for formula-fed patients with refractory symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease or signs of an allergy to cow\u2019s milk or soy protein. Unless the patient has evidence of severe nutritional compromise, continued breastfeeding should be encouraged for breastfed patients with possible modification of the mother\u2019s diet to eliminate cow\u2019s milk or soy if an allergy is suspected.\n\nBullet Summary:\nUncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux in infants should be treated with reassurance and counseling to position the infant upright for 20-30 minutes after feeding.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, we have an 8-week-old baby coming in for a well visit. The main issue here is the regurgitation of breastmilk through the nose and mouth after some feeds. The mom is worried about milk supply and whether the baby is getting enough nutrition. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the baby is breastfed every 2-3 hours for 30 minutes. The regurgitation started about two weeks ago. The mom tried limiting the volume per feed, which helped reduce the frequency. The baby doesn't have diarrhea, blood in stool, or family allergies. The older sibling had similar vomiting that went away by 12 months. Growth percentiles: four weeks ago, height 40th, weight 34th. Now, height 37th, weight 36th. So the weight has actually improved a bit, which is good. Vital signs are normal. On exam, the baby is active, lifting head and shoulders, which is age-appropriate. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness, normal bowel sounds.\n\nThe question is asking for the next step in management. The options are PPI, abdominal ultrasound, reassurance and positioning, diet modification, or switch to hydrolyzed formula.\n\nHmm. Let's think about possible causes. The baby is spitting up, which is common in infants. The key here is that it's posseting, which is common in normal infants, especially if it's after feeds and not associated with other symptoms. The fact that the mom's older child had similar issues that resolved suggests it might be a benign condition like gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Since there's no blood in stool, diarrhea, or failure to thrive (since weight percentiles are stable or slightly improved), it's probably not something like cow's milk protein allergy, which might require hydrolyzed formula (option E). Also, the growth is okay, so maybe not a feeding issue. \n\nProton pump inhibitors (option A) are usually for more severe reflux, like when there's esophagitis. But since the baby is asymptomatic except for the regurgitation and is growing okay, PPI might be overkill. Abdominal ultrasound (B) would be if there was a suspicion of an anatomical issue, like pyloric stenosis, but that usually presents with projectile vomiting, which isn't mentioned here. The baby's abdomen is soft, so probably",

The general advice from organizations like ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) is that exercise is safe and encouraged for most pregnant women, especially those with uncomplicated pregnancies. They recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, which can be spread out, like 30 minutes most days.

That's probably not right because exercise is generally encouraged unless there are complications. She has no issues, so A is out.\n\nB) Avoid soccer, continue others. Soccer is a contact sport and could have risks like falls or trauma. Even if she's low-level, maybe the recommendation is to avoid contact sports. But is that the case? I think ACOG says to avoid activities with high risk of falling or abdominal trauma, like soccer, skiing, etc. So maybe B is a contender.\n\nC) Continue current regimen. If her current exercises are safe, then maybe. But the soccer part might be the issue. The other exercises (swimming, biking) are low impact and safe. So maybe the answer is B, telling her to avoid soccer but keep the others.\n\nD) Limit moderate exercise to 30 minutes. But her current total is more than that per day on some days, but the guidelines allow up to that or more? The 150 minutes per week is the minimum, so 30 minutes 5 days is 150.

But the question states the patient's rash isn't improving. The options include viral infection (E), which would fit if it's a new viral rash. However, the family history of cancers might be a distractor here. The physical exam finding in Figure A is crucial.

So option E could be correct. Alternatively, if the rash is something else, but given the exposure, viral makes sense.

Huntington disease is characterized by atrophy of the caudate nucleus, which is a structure of the dorsal striatum.\n\nHuntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant trinucleotide (CAG) repeat disorder located on chromosome 4. HD typically presents with mood changes and abnormal movements (particularly chorea or myoclonus) over weeks to months. Although executive function can be affected early on, memory is usually preserved until relatively late in the disease. Frontotemporal dementia, in contrast, usually presents with behavioral changes, and Alzheimer disease has memory impairment as an early sign. Caudate atrophy is typically seen on head imaging in Huntington disease. This disease cannot be cured but supportive treatment includes benzodiazepines and tetrabenazine for symptomatic relief of muscle spasms.\n\nWalker presents a review of the evidence regarding the etiology of Huntington disease. He discusses that typically the onset of symptoms is in middle age after affected individuals have had children. He recommends a better understanding of the function of the mutant protein in this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alpha-synuclein aggregates would be found on brain biopsy in Parkinson disease and Lewy body dementia. Lewy body dementia is characterized by parkinsonism and visual hallucinations. Patients would present with cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and a resting tremor. Treatment is with dopamine agonists such as carbidopa/levodopa.\n\nAnswer C: Frontotemporal atrophy is consistent with a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia presents primarily with early behavioral changes, and it would not present with myoclonus. Treatment is supportive as there is no cure for this disease. Patients and their spouses may require psychiatric support for changes in behavior.\n\nAnswer D: Neurofibrillary tangles on brain biopsy would suggest a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. This disease presents with a slowly progressive cognitive decline in elderly patients. Patients have early loss of memory but have maintained motor function and behavior until later in the course of the disease.\n\nAnswer E: A positive 14-3-3 CSF assay would confirm the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Although CJD may also present with mood changes and myoclonus, CJD most prominently causes rapidly progressive dementia early in life.

        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 46-year-old man presenting with depression, strange movements, and behavioral changes. His symptoms started about two months ago. He's becoming more irritable, withdrawn, and his work performance is suffering. His physical exam shows a flat affect, facial grimacing, and sudden jerky movements in his upper extremities. The question is asking which finding is most likely on further workup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible diagnoses that fit these symptoms. The key points here are the movement disorders (jerky movements, facial grimace) along with the psychiatric symptoms like depression and personality changes. The age is mid-40s, which might be important because some neurodegenerative diseases have typical age ranges.\n\nThe options given are related to different neurological conditions. Let's go through each option:\n\nA) Alpha-synuclein aggregates on brain biopsy: This is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies like Lewy body dementia. Parkinson's typically presents with bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, but the movement here is described as sudden jerky movements, which might be more akin to myoclonus or chorea. However, Lewy body dementia can have movement disorders and psychiatric symptoms. But the age might be a bit young for Parkinson's, though not impossible.\n\nB) Dorsal striatum atrophy on head CT: The dorsal striatum is part of the basal ganglia. Atrophy here is seen in Huntington's disease. Huntington's is an autosomal dominant disorder with motor (chorea), cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. The patient's age is in the typical range for Huntington's onset (usually 30s-40s). The movement described (jerky, sudden) could be chorea. Also, the family history is unknown due to being adopted, which might mean he can't rule out a family history of Huntington's. The psychiatric symptoms like irritability and depression are also common in Huntington's. This seems plausible.\n\nC) Frontotemporal atrophy on head CT: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) involves atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes. It's associated with behavioral changes (like personality shifts, apathy, disinhibition) and language issues. The movement here might not be as prominent, but FTD can sometimes have motor symptoms. However, the movement described (jerky) might not be as typical for FTD. The age",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure (CHF). The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications. They recommend assessing BNP levels in patients who are suspected of having CHF.\n\nFigure A is a chart with changes in brain natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, sodium, and potassium that would be seen in various diseases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, and high potassium does not reflect the changes that would be seen in CHF. Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF. This pattern would be seen in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH where excessive resorption of free water results in hemodilution.\n\nAnswer E: Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and normal potassium reflect the findings in a healthy patient. This patient most likely has CHF, which would result in increased aldosterone and ADH function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCommon lab findings in heart failure include elevated BNP, elevated ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 69-year-old man presenting with shortness of breath, and this is his third time this month. His symptoms started during exertion (walking to a restaurant), which suggests possible cardiac or pulmonary issues. He doesn't have a primary care doctor and isn't on any meds. He drinks socially but doesn't smoke. Vital signs: temp 99.5\u00b0F (mildly elevated), pulse 100 (tachycardic), BP 130/90 (a bit high), respirations 18 (normal), O2 sat 96% on room air. On exam, he's fatigued. Cardiovascular exam shows an extra heart sound after S2, which is likely S3 gallop, indicating possible heart failure. Pulmonary exam has bilateral crackles, which could be from fluid overload (like in CHF) or pulmonary edema. Abdominal exam shows an obese abdomen without pain, and there's bilateral pitting edema in the legs. \n\nThe question is about which lab values would be most likely seen. The options are labeled A to E, but since the figure isn't provided, I need to think about typical lab findings in this scenario. The key clues here are the S3 gallop, bilateral crackles, and pitting edema. These are classic signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), specifically left-sided heart failure leading to pulmonary congestion (crackles) and right-sided failure causing peripheral edema. Alternatively, maybe a valvular issue, but the S3 is more common in systolic dysfunction.\n\nIn CHF, especially if it's chronic, you might see certain lab abnormalities. Let's think about common labs. BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) or NT-proBNP are often elevated in heart failure. Elevated BNP is a strong indicator. Also, electrolytes might be off, but without more info, maybe not. Liver function tests could be elevated if there's hepatic congestion from right-sided heart failure (e.g., elevated ALT, AST, bilirubin). Also, renal function might be affected due to decreased perfusion or fluid overload. \n\nLooking at possible lab sets, if one of the options has elevated BNP, that's a key point. Alternatively, if there's evidence of renal impairment (elevated creatinine, BUN), that could be there too. Also,",

Patients often present with symptoms that include headache, blurry vision, and tinnitus. Fundoscopic examination typically reveals bilateral papilledema. Vision loss is a complication of this condition with high morbidity. While there is no identifiable cause, common associations include obesity or a recent increase in weight as well as medications such as isotretinoin - a vitamin A derivative that is often used in the management of severe nodulocystic acne vulgaris. Management should first involve imaging of the brain (CT or MRI) to exclude elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure due to other causes such as brain tumor, dural sinus thrombosis, or hydrocephalus. The diagnosis is made via lumbar puncture revealing increased opening pressure. Lumbar puncture can also result in therapeutic relief. The specimen should be sent for gram stain, culture, and viral PCR to rule out other etiologies. Long term treatment is centered on weight loss and avoiding causative agents. Acetazolamide and serial lumbar punctures are other treatments.\n\nBoyter reviews the clinical presentation and management of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. They found the condition is most common among obese women in their 20's, but it also may occur in children, men, and older adults. They recommend referral for patients to see a neurologist for ongoing management of headaches and other symptoms, as well as an ophthalmologist or neuro-ophthalmologist for monitoring papilledema, given the risk of vision loss.\n\nFigure/Illustration A: The figure depicts a patient with severe nodules and cysts (red arrows) consistent with severe inflammatory nodulocystic acne that would be suitable for treatment with isotretinoin.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cerebrovascular accidents can be embolic or hemorrhagic in nature and often result in persistent neurologic deficits or resolution of an acute neurologic deficit in a patient with cerebrovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). This young, healthy patient with intermittent headache and neurologic symptoms without a family history of hypercoagulable state is unlikely to have suffered from a cerebrovascular accident.\n\nAnswer B: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis that is typically seen in elderly patients (>60 years of age) and presents with tenderness of the ipsilateral temple and elevated inflammatory markers. Many patients with GCA have one or more constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, fatigue, anorexia, malaise) in addition to symptoms such as new onset headache or jaw claudication.\n\nAnswer D: Meniere disease affects the inner ear and is characterized by severe episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and fullness in the ear. Patients are often women between the ages of 40 and 60. Headaches and blurry vision are not a classic part of the clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer E: Migraines present with severe headaches that can be incapacitating with associated photophobia and phonophobia. In some cases, patients may present with an aura that precedes or occurs during the migraine. The presence of papilledema suggests elevated intracranial pressure and is not typically seen in migraines.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension may be a side effect of isotretinoin.",

She started a new oral medication for a skin condition two months ago. The key findings here are the neurological exam showing papilledema, which is swelling of the optic disc. Papilledema is typically a sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) \u2013 Usually presents with sudden neurological deficits, like stroke symptoms. The patient here has a gradual onset over a month, so maybe less likely unless there's a bleed, but BP is normal.\n\nB) Giant cell arteritis (GCA) \u2013 Typically affects older adults, especially over 50, and involves temporal artery inflammation. She's 19, so age doesn't fit. Also, GCA can cause headaches, vision issues, but not sure about tinnitus. Plus, the skin findings might not align.\n\nC) Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) \u2013 Also called pseudotumor cerebri. Common in young, overweight women, but can occur in others. Classic symptoms are headaches, visual disturbances (blurry vision, papilledema), and sometimes tinnitus. It can be triggered by medications like tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline) which are used for skin conditions. The patient started a new oral med two months ago, which might be a trigger. The skin findings in Figure A might be related to the skin condition she's being treated for, not the IIH itself.\n\nD) Meniere disease \u2013 Causes episodic vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. The vision issues and papilledema don't fit here. Meniere's is more about inner ear issues.\n\nE) Migraine \u2013 Can present with headaches and visual aura, but papilledema isn't a typical feature. Migraines don't usually cause papilledema unless there's a complicated form, which is rare.\n\nThe key points are the papilledema (pointing to increased ICP) and the recent medication. IIH is a likely candidate, especially if the medication is a known trigger. The skin findings might be from her acne or another condition being treated, but the neurological symptoms point more to IIH. GCA is less likely due to age.

        "reason": "This patient with a history of alcohol use disorder and signs of liver failure (jaundice, ascites, spider angiomas, and ecchymoses) presents with acute hematemesis and hypovolemic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea) most concerning for a variceal hemorrhage. The first step in the resuscitation of patients with variceal hemorrhage is rapid administration of intravenous (IV) fluids and octreotide.\n\nEsophageal and gastric varices, most commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, are abnormally distended veins that are a product of venous congestion from portal hypertension. As these varices can project into the gastrointestinal lumen, they are subject to rupture either spontaneously or by mechanical disruption (e.g., tearing by food particles). Variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis as it can quickly progress to hemorrhagic shock or airway loss (if profuse vomiting is present). Patients should immediately receive 2 large-bore peripheral IVs (or central IV access) with which to administer IV fluid boluses to increase circulating volume. Blood should be transfused as needed, and a massive transfusion protocol may be needed. Patients should also be given octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor, in an effort to divert blood away from the hemorrhaging varices. Other treatments that should be given include ceftriaxone (to reduce bacteremia and mortality), proton pump inhibitors, and possibly interventions such as tranexamic acid. Upper GI endoscopy and banding are the definitive therapy.\n\nStanley et al review the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding with initial IV fluid resuscitation as the first measure to achieve hemodynamic stability. They also report that for patients with cirrhosis, vasoactive drugs such as octreotide should be started as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected. Red blood cell transfusion is indicated at a hemoglobin transfusion of 7.0-8.0 g/dL. Definitive therapy is endoscopy with variceal ligation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Balloon tamponade is often performed in the emergency department or intensive care unit as a temporizing measure to achieve hemostasis for patients with severe and persistent variceal hemorrhage. The balloon is inserted into the esophagus or stomach and inflated to apply direct pressure to the bleeding varices; this buys valuable time in the transition to definitive endoscopic management.\n\nAnswer B: Ceftriaxone is administered to patients with cirrhosis who present with an upper gastrointestinal bleed as a prophylactic measure against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This patient is hemodynamically unstable, and antibiotics should not delay initial intravenous fluid resuscitation as well as other measures to reduce and/or stop the bleeding. While this patient should receive ceftriaxone, it is more dire to first give fluids, blood, and octreotide.\n\nAnswer C: Nadolol or other nonselective beta-blocker therapy is indicated as secondary prophylaxis to prevent future bleeding episodes for patients with a history of variceal hemorrhage. Non-selective beta blockers such as nadolol decrease portal pressure, but are contraindicated in the acute setting as they could exacerbate hypovolemic shock by reducing cardiac output.\n\nAnswer D: Platelet transfusion is required for patients with variceal hemorrhage with an initial platelet count < 50,000/mm^3, and for those who receive a significant amount of blood products during their resuscitation (significant dilutional thrombocytopenia can occur after 10-12 units of transfused red blood cells). This patient's platelet count is above 50,000/mm^3, and he has not yet received blood products.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of a cirrhosis patient with acute variceal hemorrhage is the rapid administration of intravenous fluids and octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor.",

On exam, he has signs like distended abdomen with fluid wave (so ascites), jaundice, spider angiomas, and ecchymoses. His vital signs show tachycardia (pulse 125) but BP is 98/68, which isn't too low yet. His hemoglobin is low (8.8 g/dL) and platelets are 80k. They gave him 1L NS already.\n\nThe question is about the most appropriate initial management step. The options are balloon tamponade, ceftriaxone, nadolol, octreotide, or platelet transfusion.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the possible causes of his bleeding. The history of alcohol use, along with spider angiomas, jaundice, and ascites points towards liver disease, likely cirrhosis. In cirrhosis, common complications include esophageal varices, which can bleed. The bright red blood suggests active bleeding from a source in the upper GI tract, possibly varices. \n\nHematemesis with bright red blood and a history of alcoholism makes me think of variceal bleeding. The physical exam findings support portal hypertension (ascites, spider angiomas, jaundice). So the most likely cause here is esophageal varices rupture.\n\nNow, the management of acute variceal bleeding. The initial steps usually involve resuscitation with fluids (which they did with NS), then interventions to stop the bleeding. The options here include balloon tamponade (Sengstaken-Blakemore tube), which is a temporizing measure to apply pressure on the varices. Other options like octreotide are vasopressin analogs that reduce portal pressure. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic, maybe for prophylaxis against infection in cirrhosis, but not the first step. Nadolol is a non-selective beta-blocker, but in acute bleeding, you wouldn't start that. Platelet transfusion might be considered if platelets are very low, but 80k is on the lower side but maybe not critically low unless there's active bleeding.

The exudate is classically thick with small yellow \u201csulfur\u201d granules, although it may also be serosanguinous.

The fact that she couldn't close her mouth makes me think of trismus, which is a sign of temporomandibular joint involvement, often seen in infections like Ludwig's angina or maybe a dental abscess that's spread.\n\nLudwig's angina is a serious infection of the floor of the mouth, typically caused by dental infections. It can lead to swelling, trismus, difficulty swallowing, and airway obstruction. The presence of a mass and drainage supports an abscess. The bluish color might be due to subcutaneous emphysema, which can occur with gas-forming bacteria.

Osteoarthritis may be seen with higher incidence in patients with homocystinuria.

BWS presents with macrosomia (\u201cgigantism\u201d), which is defined as height and weight > 97th percentile. BWS additionally presents with omphalocele, hemihyperplasia, visceromegaly, neonatal hypoglycemia, and other embryonal tumors, including hepatoblastoma and neuroblastoma. Treatment is with surgical correction of defects.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHomocystinuria presents with Marfanoid habitus, fair complexion, intellectual disability, downward lens subluxation, and an increased risk of thromboembolic events.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 3-year-old boy with a recent adoption, so limited medical history. The main points here are his physical characteristics and the findings. He's larger than peers, in high percentiles for height, weight, head circumference. He has developmental delay, fair complexion, tall stature, prominent sternum, joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, and downward lens subluxation in the right eye. The question is about which complication he's most likely to develop from the options given.\n\nHmm, the key features here point towards a genetic disorder. Let me think about the symptoms. Joint hypermobility and hyperelastic skin make me think of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the downward lens subluxation is a big clue. Marfan syndrome comes to mind because that's associated with lens dislocation, tall stature, and other features. Marfan is caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene. \n\nIn Marfan syndrome, people often have aortic root dilation, which can lead to aortic aneurysms and aortic dissection (option A). They can also have other issues like mitral valve prolapse. The developmental delay might be part of it, though sometimes Marfan is associated with mild learning issues but not always. The prominent sternum could be a pigeon chest (pectus carinatum), which is seen in Marfan. \n\nLooking at the options: Aortic dissection (A) is a common complication in Marfan. Medullary thyroid cancer (B) is more associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Osteoarthritis (C) could be from joint issues, but Marfan's joint problems are more about laxity rather than early osteoarthritis. Thromboembolic stroke (D) doesn't immediately link. Wilms tumor (E) is a kidney cancer in kids, more with Wilm's tumor and certain syndromes like WAGR, but not Marfan.\n\nSo the most likely complication here would be aortic dissection. Let me double-check the lens subluxation: yes, that's classic for Marfan. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nA",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with obtundation, bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, thinning of her hair, and hyponatremia, which are concerning for myxedema coma. A serum TSH and free T4 would be most informative in confirming this diagnosis.\n\nMyxedema coma (decompensated hypothyroidism) is the most life-threatening manifestation of hypothyroidism. Key clinical features include hypothermia (often the temperature is <95.9\u00b0F (35.5\u00b0C)), bradycardia, hypotension, bradypnea (causing a respiratory acidosis), hypoxia, and obtundation. Immediate management is centered on warming the patient, warmed IV fluids, and protecting the patient's airway, if needed. If there is high clinical suspicion for myxedema coma, then IV levothyroxine can be given empirically. Otherwise, the TSH and free T4 should be checked, which will reveal an elevated TSH and a low free T4. Patients are often critically ill and require active rewarming and close monitoring in an ICU setting.\n\nWall reviews myxedema coma. Wall notes that myxedema coma is a life-threatening manifestation of hypothyroidism. She recommends that generally IV T4 (levothyroxine) is preferred over IV T3 in initial management.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering glucagon would be appropriate in a beta-blocker overdose, which presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. There is no indication that this patient intentionally overdosed, and her hyponatremia and thinning hair supports a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Other treatments that can be given in a beta-blocker overdose including epinephrine, calcium, insulin, dextrose, and lipid emulsion therapy.\n\nAnswer C: Obtaining blood cultures and a serum lactate is the appropriate management of sepsis/septic shock. Generally, patients with septic shock present with hypotension (refractory to fluid resuscitation), tachycardia, and fever or hypothermia. Though myocardial depression may happen in critically ill patients who are about to undergo cardiac arrest, hypothyroidism better explains this patient's constellation of symptoms. It would be appropriate to obtain cultures and a serum lactate in this patient while the differential is being narrowed.\n\nAnswer D: Performing a CT scan of the head would be indicated at some point in the workup of patients with altered mental status if there was a suspected central nervous system etiology such as a subdural hematoma. However, hemodynamically unstable patients should never be sent to the CT scanner prior to stabilization and resuscitation. A subdural hematoma is more common in older patients and patients with alcohol use disorder who experience head trauma as the atrophy of their brain makes the bridging veins more vulnerable.\n\nAnswer E: Performing an echocardiogram may show reduced cardiac function; however, it is unlikely to reveal the underlying cause of this patient's hypotension and bradycardia other than showing poor cardiac function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMyxedema coma presents as a critically ill, obtunded patient who is hypothermic, bradycardic, and hypotensive, and the diagnosis can be supported with a high TSH and a low free T4.",

She has a baseline dementia, which is important because that can affect her presentation. The key points here are her vital signs and lab results. Her temperature is low (95\u00b0F), blood pressure is low initially (84/54), which improved after fluids. Pulse is 50, respirations 9/min but O2 sat is 98%. The physical exam shows she's obtunded, withdraws to pain, cool and pale skin, thin hair. No trauma. The sodium is 120 mEq/L, which is hyponatremia.\n\nThe question is asking which test will confirm the underlying cause. The options are glucagon, TSH/T4, blood cultures/lactate, head CT, or echo.\n\nFirst, hyponatremia can have various causes. The low sodium here is quite significant (120). The symptoms include altered mental status, which is common in severe hyponatremia. But the question is about the underlying cause of her symptoms. The low sodium could be due to SIADH, hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency, thyroid issues, etc.\n\nThe patient's low temperature and low BP (though responsive to fluids) might suggest hypovolemia, but the sodium is low, which complicates that. Alternatively, hypothyroidism can present with low sodium (due to decreased free water excretion), bradycardia, hypotension, cold skin, and altered mental status. The thin hair could be a sign of hypothyroidism (myxedema). The low TSH and low T4 would indicate hypothyroidism (if TSH is low, that's central hypothyroidism maybe, but more commonly, primary hypothyroidism presents with high TSH and low T4). Wait, primary hypothyroidism is high TSH, low T4. So if the TSH is low and T4 is low, that might be central hypothyroidism, but either way, checking TSH and free T4 would help diagnose hypothyroidism as a cause of her symptoms and hyponatremia.\n\nAnother angle: the hyponatremia could be due to SIADH.

Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor). Finally, the fourth line vasopressor for septic shock is phenylephrine.\n\nLevy et al. review sepsis. They update the Surviving Sepsis campaign which gives the most up to date management guidelines of sepsis including adequate fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors. They recommend early antibiotics and resuscitation to minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia. Note the presence of P waves (red arrows highlighting several examples) that are present throughout all leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardioversion would be appropriate in an unstable patient with unstable vital signs in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation would present with an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Cardioversion would not be indicated in sinus tachycardia.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone is a potent glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid properties. While giving an IV steroid may have a permissive effect on blood pressure (via upregulating alpha-1 receptors on the vasculature) there is no reason that this patient would have a low cortisol level (such as in chronic steroid use). Epinephrine is a better answer in this case, though steroids can be considered. Steroids are typically reserved for patients failing at least 2 vasopressors (unless they have a known cortisol-deficient state).\n\nAnswer D: Normal saline is unlikely to benefit this patient as he has already been sufficiently fluid resuscitated. Moreover, it seems the patient may be developing pulmonary edema (hypoxia, jugular venous distension), a sign of fluid overload.\n\nAnswer E: Phenylephrine is the fourth line vasopressor and is an alpha-1 agonist. It is much less potent than norepinephrine and epinephrine, and would not be started in the management of septic shock until the patient has received epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn septic shock, the vasopressors given (in order) are norepinephrine, epinephrine/vasopressin, then phenylephrine.",

The most appropriate next step in management would be thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine ablation.\n\nPapillary thyroid carcinoma represents the majority of malignant thyroid cancers. They are slow-growing and are found in the hormone-producing follicular cells of the thyroid. Typically, these tumors are found incidentally on imaging. Risk factors for thyroid malignancy include a history of radiation exposure, female sex, and positive family history. Nodules with minimal uptake on radioactive iodine scan, firm and immobile solitary nodules, and rapidly growing nodules with associated hoarseness are more suggestive of thyroid malignancy. Findings on histology include empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing, psammoma bodies, and nuclear grooves. The treatment is thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine ablation of any remaining thyroid cells. Long-term care should include levothyroxine at a dose sufficient to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release that may stimulate any remaining malignant cells.\n\nOakley et al. studied if relatives of patients diagnosed as having papillary thyroid carcinoma are at increased risk using a retrospective cohort study. The authors found first-degree relatives were at a 5-fold increased risk, and second-degree relatives were at a 2-fold increased risk. The authors recommend more research into optimal approaches to screening for thyroid cancers.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a histology section showing a psammoma body (blue circle), which are round, concentrically laminated calcifications that are formed after necrosis of papillary structures. Psammoma bodies and nuclei with central clearing (yellow circle) and nuclear grooves are common histology findings for papillary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Levothyroxine would be the treatment of choice in hypothyroidism and is important in the long-term care of papillary thyroid carcinoma to suppress the TSH release that may stimulate any remaining malignant cells after treatment (thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine).\n\nAnswer B: Methimazole is an agent that blocks thyroid peroxidase, thus inhibiting the synthesis of thyroid hormones. It is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and does not have a role in the treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nAnswer C: Radioactive iodine is used as an adjunct after thyroidectomy in the treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma in order to target any thyroid cells that may remain even after surgical excision. Surgery is the primary therapy for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Radioactive iodine is the primary method of therapy in cases of Grave disease, toxic adenoma, or multinodular goiter.\n\nAnswer D: Repeating an ultrasound in 6 months to assess the growth of the nodule or the development of suspicious characteristics is appropriate in cases where the ultrasound and biopsy findings are consistent with a benign thyroid nodule.

The fact that it's been enlarging over a year might indicate growth, which is another red flag. Since the nodule was biopsied, the pathology results would determine the next step.

Cervical spondylosis is a common cause of cervical radiculopathy in elderly patients with chronic neck pain, especially in patients with findings suggestive of degenerative joint diseases (history of lumbar fusion and hip arthroplasty).\n\nCervical spondylosis is caused by degeneration of the intervertebral disc with possible disc herniation and facet joints with osteophyte formation. These osteophytes and cervical disc herniation can cause compression of exiting nerve roots, leading to radiculopathy. Radicular symptoms depend on the nerve root affected. For example, C6 radiculopathy causes weakness in wrist extension and a decreased brachioradialis reflex while C7 radiculopathy causes weakness in elbow extension and wrist flexion with a decreased triceps reflex. Sensory symptoms may be present depending on the dermatome affected. The diagnosis is confirmed with MRI.

Treatment includes riluzole (to improve survival) and symptomatic management.\n\nAnswer B: Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel at the wrist. While the thenar eminence is typically spared due to take-off of the palmar cutaneous branch proximal to the carpal tunnel, the thumb and index finger are also affected. This patient\u2019s symptoms primarily involve the middle finger, which is more indicative of a radiculopathy. Treatment is activity modification, splinting, and ultimately, surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel if refractory.\n\nAnswer D: Syringomyelia is caused by a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within the spinal cord that leads to central cord syndrome, characterized by weakness that is greater in the upper extremities compared to lower extremities and loss of pain and temperature sensation in a cape-like distribution in the upper back and upper extremities.

Wait, the triceps brachii is innervated by the radial nerve. But the radial nerve also supplies the posterior interosseous nerve for wrist and finger extension. Wait, but the triceps reflex is a deep tendon reflex tested at the triceps, which is part of the C6-C8 nerve roots. Wait",

Newly diagnosed leukocoria should be urgently referred to ophthalmology to exclude retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular cancer of childhood caused by mutations in the RB1 tumor suppressor gene that encodes the retinoblastoma protein. Retinoblastoma typically presents as leukocoria in a child under the age of 3 with other signs including strabismus, nystagmus, or a red, inflamed eye. Treatment options include chemotherapy, laser photocoagulation, radiation, cryotherapy, and enucleation. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important for optimal visual outcome and survival.\n\nFrancis et al. study the risk of extraocular extension in eyes with retinoblastoma that received intravitreous chemotherapy injections. The authors find that the risk of extraocular extension is small. The authors recommend the regular use of precautionary injection methods including lowering of intraocular pressure, cryotherapy, ocular surface irrigation, and ultrasonic biomicroscopy surveillance of the injection site.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows a child with leukocoria (blue circle) in the left eye.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Biopsy of the eye is contraindicated in retinoblastoma due to the risk of tumor seeding.\n\nAnswer B: Genetic testing can be used to determine if a patient has the hereditary form of retinoblastoma, characterized by germline RB1 mutations, as opposed to the nonheritable form, which is associated with somatic RB1 mutations. An ophthalmological evaluation is required first to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAnswer C: While magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits should be performed in all children with suspected retinoblastoma to assess disease extent, an ophthalmological evaluation should be completed first.\n\nAnswer E: Reassurance or reevaluation at the next well-child visit is not appropriate management of newly diagnosed leukocoria given that undiagnosed retinoblastoma can be vision- and life-threatening.\n\nBullet Summary:\nLeukocoria, or a white pupillary reflex, in a child requires urgent ophthalmologic referral to rule out retinoblastoma.",

The key part here is the fundoscopic exam showing a finding in Figure A, which we can't see, but the question is about the next step in management.\n\nThe options are biopsy, genetic testing, MRI of brain/orbits, ophthalmology referral, or reevaluation. Since the question mentions a fundoscopic finding, the first thought is something related to the eyes. The exam shows normal pupils, eye movements, and alignment. But the fundoscopic finding is the clue here. Common fundoscopic findings in kids could be things like drusen, retinoblastoma, Coats' disease, or maybe something benign like physiologic hyperemia (which is common and normal in kids). \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the next step. If there's an abnormal finding on fundoscopy that the pediatrician notices, but the rest of the eye exam is normal, the next step would depend on what that finding is. Since we don't have Figure A, maybe the question is referring to a common finding that requires a specialist. For example, if there's a lesion like retinoblastoma, that's an emergency and would need urgent ophthalmology referral. Alternatively, if it's something like a coloboma or another structural issue, an ophthalmologist would be needed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fundoscopic finding is normal for age, but the question is trying to trick us. But since the pediatrician is continuing the exam and noting other things are normal, but the fundus has a finding, the next step would be to refer to an ophthalmologist to evaluate that specific finding. MRI might be needed if there's a suspicion of a CNS issue, but the question doesn't mention any neurological symptoms. Genetic testing could be if there's a hereditary eye condition, but again, without more info, the most straightforward next step is to refer to an ophthalmologist. Biopsy seems too extreme unless it's a mass, but that's not indicated here. So the answer is D, ophthalmology referral.\n</think>\n\nD",

This constellation of symptoms is concerning for a concussion.\n\nA concussion occurs after blunt trauma to the head and is common in athletics and motor vehicle collisions. Patients may present initially with symptoms including confusion, repeat questioning, repeating themselves, and amnesia surrounding the event. A thorough neurological exam is important as there should be no neurologic deficits in a concussion. Patients with a classic history and reassuring exam require rest from physical and cognitive activity. Post-concussive syndrome may present with chronic headaches, dizziness, trouble sleeping, trouble focusing, nausea, and difficulties with learning and concentrating. Mood changes such as depression and anxiety are common. Any patient with a concerning mechanism or symptoms should have a head CT to rule out other more severe diagnoses.\n\nPertab et al. review concussion and its presentation. They note that concussion can cause many symptoms including trouble focusing, mood changes, headaches, and also autonomic nervous system anomalies. They recommend reviewing the constellation of symptoms to make the diagnosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cerebral contusions are common after head trauma and may present with confusion, obtundation, neurologic deficits, and amnesia. While a severe concussion and a cerebral contusion have overlap, given this patient\u2019s age, mechanism, and symptoms, concussion is more likely. A head CT would demonstrate contusion (hyperdense intraparenchymal lesion) with a possible contrecoup injury.\n\nAnswer C: Diffuse axonal injury occurs after a severe CNS injury with an obtunded patient who is typically unresponsive. CT imaging will show blurring of the gray-white interface with punctate hemorrhages. These patients have a very poor prognosis. They often are obtunded with minimal neurologic function.\n\nAnswer D: Epidural hematoma presents with trauma and the classic \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome including a lucid interval followed by progressive obtundation and fixed, dilated pupils. Symptoms are rapidly progressive as this is an arterial bleed. CT scan would demonstrate a hyperdense lens-shaped lesion (composed of blood). A burr hole may relieve pressure and can be life-saving.\n\nAnswer E: Subarachnoid hemorrhage may present after trauma with a severe headache and meningeal signs. Patients may demonstrate focal neurologic deficits in severe cases. CT scan will demonstrate blood in the subarachnoid space and lumbar puncture would demonstrate blood in the CSF.

Patients with an expanding bleed will require surgical decompression to avoid herniation syndromes.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage. Subgaleal hemorrhages occur in newborns and are caused by vacuum-assisted deliveries. Treatment is usually supportive as the bleeding will resolve by itself. Some patients with severe bleeds may require transfusion due to excessive blood loss.\n\nAnswer D: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematomas occur in newborns and are caused by rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor. Treatment is supportive as the blood will resolve and be resorbed.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding between the skull and dura mater describes an epidural hematoma.

This suggests a diagnosis of central retinal artery occlusion and management should focus on control of underlying risk factors given that he is 2 days out from the event.\n\nSymptoms of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) include sudden, painless, complete, and normally unilateral vision loss. A fundoscopic exam can show pallor of the optic disc, diffuse ischemic whitening of the retina, cherry-red macula, retinal edema, and constricted/bloodless retinal arterioles. The center of the macula appears red because the photoreceptor layer at the fovea is perfused by the posterior choroidal vasculature rather than the central retinal artery. Treatment involves surgical decompression of the retinal anterior chamber, ideally within 1 hour of the occlusion. Tissue plasminogen activator should be administered if the patient presents within an acceptable time frame. If surgical intervention is not readily available, additional steps with minimal evidence to support their use include ocular massage (to dislodge the embolus) and either carbogen therapy or hyperbaric oxygen. Chronic management includes control of underlying risk factors with aspirin and statin therapy.\n\nDattilo et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of central retinal artery occlusion. They discuss how treatments have not been particularly effective in the treatment of this disorder.

This medication is used in patients who sustain an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of developing symptoms. A stroke in the posterior lobe can present with cortical hemianopsia.\n\nAnswer D: Retinal photocoagulation is used to treat diabetic retinopathy. In diabetic retinopathy, symptoms of painless vision loss present gradually. A retinal exam would show retinal hemorrhage and possibly neovascularization.\n\nAnswer E: Timolol is a beta-blocker used to treat glaucoma.

The key points here are the sudden onset, painless, curtain-like loss, which makes me think of a retinal detachment or maybe a central retinal artery or vein occlusion. But given his atrial fibrillation, another possibility is an embolic event leading to a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or maybe a stroke. However, the timing is two days ago.

But maybe the question is about the next step regardless of timing?\n\nLooking at the fundoscopic exam (though we can't see Figure A), the description mentions 20/800 vision. CRAO typically presents with a pale retina, cherry-red spot at the macula. If it's a vein occlusion, maybe different findings. But the patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of emboli, so CRAO is a consideration. However, another possibility is a retinal detachment, which can also present with a curtain-like obstruction.

But treatment for CRAO is time-sensitive. The standard is that within 24 hours, maybe consider thrombolytics, but after that, it's too late. Since the patient presented two days later, maybe the options here are different. Alternatively, maybe it's a central vein occlusion (CRVO), which is also possible. But CRVO is more hemorrhages and maybe different management.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a retinal detachment, then photocoagulation or surgery would be needed, but that",

        "answer_idx": "B",
        "reason": "This young patient who presents with non-painful unilateral bloody nipple discharge and no palpable mass on breast exam most likely has an intraductal papilloma.\n\nIntraductal papilloma is a benign epithelial tumor that develops in the lactiferous ducts of the breast and is the most common cause of bloody nipple discharge in premenopausal women. Patients typically present with painless unilateral bloody nipple discharge, and often there is no mass palpable on breast exam. Ultrasound is the initial method for evaluation and may reveal an intraductal mass, but if results are inconclusive, further imaging with mammography is indicated. If the results of both still remain inconclusive, galactography (radiography after injecting radiopaque contrast into the duct system) is the most accurate imaging method for diagnosing intraductal papilloma. A core biopsy of the intraductal mass should be obtained, and if results show papilloma with atypia, treatment would be surgical excision of the involved duct to rule out a concomitant malignant neoplasm.\n\nKhan et al. review the treatment of intraductal papilloma and note that in lesions with core biopsy showing papilloma with atypia, surgical excision revealed the diagnosis of a concomitant invasive or ductal in situ cancer is common. The authors also find that in patients whose core biopsies showed papilloma without atypia, the likelihood of cancer was much lower. The authors recommend that since the diagnosis of intraductal papilloma carries an increased risk of breast cancer compared to the general population, these patients should be monitored accordingly.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a neoplastic lesion confined to the breast duct that if untreated develops into invasive ductal carcinoma. Typically, patients are asymptomatic, and lesions are detected via screening mammography. Though it can sometimes present with nipple discharge, this is less common. Unilateral painless bloody nipple discharge is more likely to be due to intraductal papilloma, though no mass may be palpable for either diagnosis.\n\nAnswer C: Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer, which typically presents as a firm, immobile, painless lump in the breast, sometimes associated with nipple discharge, overlying skin changes, inverted nipple, and/or axillary lymphadenopathy. As with DCIS, nipple discharge may be present but is usually not bloody as in cases of intraductal papilloma.\n\nAnswer D: Mammary duct ectasia is a benign condition in which a milk duct in the breast widens and its walls thicken, leading to blockage and build-up of fluid in the duct. This is usually asymptomatic but can present with off-white or greenish nipple discharge. It may also result in infection of the affected duct, leading to periductal mastitis and a tender, erythematous breast. It tends to occur in perimenopausal women and often resolves without treatment, though if symptoms persist it can be treated with antibiotics and duct excision.\n\nAnswer E: Paget disease of the breast often presents as a scaly, raw, vesicular, or ulcerated lesion that begins on the nipple and then spreads to the areola, sometimes associated with bloody nipple discharge. Pain, burning, and pruritis are also common presenting symptoms. There is often an underlying breast carcinoma; thus, any patient with Paget disease should be evaluated with a mammogram. Although this patient has bloody nipple discharge, she does not present with a painful, scaly, raw, or vesiculated lesion that would be concerning for Paget disease of the breast.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIntraductal papilloma often manifests in patients as painless unilateral bloody nipple discharge, and typically no mass is palpable on exam.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 34-year-old nulliparous woman with a two-week history of copper-colored discharge from her right nipple. No tenderness, skin changes, or masses found. She's otherwise healthy. The options are various breast conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the possible causes of nipple discharge. The color is copper-colored, which I think is a type of bloody discharge. Bloody discharge can be due to several things. Since she's nulliparous, pregnancy-related causes like galactorrhea might not be the case here, but that's usually milky, not bloody.\n\nThe key points here are the age and the nature of the discharge. The options given are ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), intraductal papilloma, invasive ductal carcinoma, mammary duct ectasia, and Paget disease.\n\nIntraductal papilloma is a benign tumor that occurs in the milk ducts. It's more common in middle-aged women, but can occur in younger women too. It often presents with a bloody or serosanguinous discharge from a single duct. Since the discharge here is from a single nipple and no mass is palpated, this might fit.\n\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-invasive cancer. It might present with nipple discharge, but it's usually associated with a mass or other findings. However, sometimes it can present with discharge alone. But given her age (34 is relatively young for DCIS), maybe less likely unless there's a family history, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nInvasive ductal carcinoma would likely present with a palpable mass, which the exam didn't find. So maybe not that.\n\nMammary duct ectasia is more common in perimenopausal women. It can cause nipple discharge, but often with some inflammation, maybe some skin changes like redness or inversion, which aren't present here. The discharge might be greenish or purulent, but I'm not sure.\n\nPaget disease is associated with eczema-like changes of the nipple and is usually accompanied by an underlying cancer. The patient here doesn't have skin changes, so that's less likely.\n\nSo putting it together, intraductal papilloma (option B) is the most likely. It's a common cause of unilateral bloody discharge without a mass, especially in a younger woman. Even though DCIS is a consideration, the lack of a mass and younger age",

        "reason": "This patient with a history of possible anabolic steroid use (wrestler with acne) who presents with right upper quadrant pain and an enhancing lesion in the liver most likely has a hepatic adenoma. The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma. They found that various molecular groups have been identified allowing for subtyping of these lesions. They recommend performing a CT scan to better characterize these lesions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT with an enhancing mass with a hypoattenuating fatty component. This is characteristically seen in large hepatic adenomas, which are solitary well-marginated lesions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole would be an effective treatment if this patient had contracted Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food or water on his recent trip to Mexico. While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma. If an adenoma is on the differential, biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of rupture and hemorrhage intraoperatively.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHepatic adenomas are benign, vascular liver masses associated with oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids that should be promptly resected if large and symptomatic.",

The patient is a 21-year-old man presenting with right lower quadrant pain, which is classic for appendicitis, and that's confirmed by the CT scan. But there's also a large liver mass found incidentally. The question is about the next best step after addressing the appendicitis.\n\nFirst, let's look at his history. He mentions a history of unprotected sex with multiple partners and intravenous drug use, especially during a trip to Mexico. That raises red flags for infections like hepatitis B or C, or maybe something like HIV. The liver mass could be related to that. Also, he's had mild right upper quadrant discomfort since the start of the wrestling season, which might have been a clue but was overlooked until now.\n\nThe options are: metronidazole (A), sofosbuvir (B), follow-up CT in 3 months (C), biopsy (D), or resection (E). \n\nMetronidazole is an antibiotic used for anaerobic infections or conditions like amoebic liver abscess. Since he has a history of IV drug use and travel to Mexico, maybe amoebic infection is possible? But the liver mass in the context of a 6cm size might not be the first thought here. Also, appendicitis is already confirmed, so maybe the liver mass is a separate issue.\n\nSofosbuvir is a medication for hepatitis C. If the liver mass is due to HCV-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), then managing HCV might be part of the plan. But would that be the next step before knowing the mass's nature?\n\nOption C is a follow-up CT. Sometimes, for incidental findings, you might monitor, but a 6cm mass is pretty big. Monitoring might not be the best next step here.\n\nBiopsy (D) could help determine the nature of the mass\u2014whether it's malignant, abscess, cyst, etc. But biopsying a liver mass can have risks like bleeding or spreading cancer cells. However, if it's an abscess, maybe a biopsy isn't the first step.\n\nResection (E) is a big surgery. If the mass is cancerous, like HCC, and resectable, that might be curative.

The first booster dose then consists of Tdap at age 11-12, with a tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine every 10 years afterwards.

He moved to El Salvador at 11 and came back to the US a year ago. His vaccination history is given, so I need to check which vaccines he might need now based on current guidelines.\n\nFirst, looking at the DTaP vaccine. He had his last DTaP at age 5, 14 years ago. Wait, DTaP is for children, and the booster for adults and older kids is Tdap. The recommendation is that everyone should get a Tdap booster once as an adolescent (usually around 11-12 years old) to update from DTaP. Since he got his last DTaP at 5, he might not have had the Tdap booster. Even though he moved to El Salvador, the US guidelines would still apply here. Since he's 19 now, he probably missed that Tdap booster. So he needs Tdap now.\n\nNext, the meningococcal vaccine. He had the second dose 3 years ago. The meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is given as a booster at age 16 or older if the first dose was given between 11-12. Since he had the second dose 3 years ago, that might be sufficient, especially since he's 19 now. Not sure if that's needed again, but the question doesn't mention any high-risk factors, so maybe that's okay.\n\nInfluenza vaccine: he got one 2 months ago. Since the question is about current recommendations, the influenza vaccine is annual, so if it's the current flu season, he might need another, but the question says he just had it 2 months ago. Unless there's a specific reason to repeat, but probably not needed now. The options include influenza in some answers, but maybe that's not necessary here.\n\nTetanus boosters are every 10 years. His last tetanus was part of the DTaP at age 5. Since it's been 14 years, he's past due. But the options have Td or Tdap. Since he's 19, he should get Tdap as the booster to also cover pertussis, unless he's already had a Tdap before. Wait, the question says he had DTaP 14 years ago",

Risk factors for pyloric stenosis include bottle feeding and exposure to macrolide antibiotics in the patient or mother. Protracted vomiting frequently leads to hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.

Typical episodes last 15 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks may be associated with the circadian rhythm, as patients may notice that they get headaches at night. Because of the extreme pain, cluster headaches are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"suicide\" headaches. These headaches may present with autonomic symptoms, such as lacrimation and rhinorrhea. Horner syndrome may also occur, defined by a unilateral triad of ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Acute management of cluster headaches includes administration of 100% oxygen. Other options include triptans. The first-line medication for prophylaxis of cluster headaches is verapamil.

Now, his physical exam shows a smaller right pupil (2 mm vs. 5 mm left), but the rest of the neuro exam is normal. The question is about the most appropriate prophylactic treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on here. The key symptoms are the eye pain, unilateral (right side) involvement, tearing previously, and anisocoria (unequal pupil sizes). The anisocoria here is significant because the right pupil is smaller. Since the extraocular movements are intact, that might rule out some muscle issues. The fact that the pain is behind the eye and the previous episode with tearing makes me think of cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are known to present with severe unilateral orbital or retro-orbital pain, tearing, nasal congestion on the same side, and sometimes miosis (small pupil) and ptosis. The anisocoria here fits with miosis on the affected side.\n\nThe next step is considering the options for prophylactic treatment. The question is about prevention, not acute treatment. Cluster headaches have specific prophylactic treatments. Let me recall the options given:\n\nA) Ibuprofen \u2013 that's a NSAID, usually for pain, but not a prophylactic for cluster headaches.\n\nB) Oxygen \u2013 I think oxygen is used for acute attacks, not prophylaxis.

He's not very compliant with his antiretroviral therapy (ART). His current CD4 count is 150 cells/\u00b5L, which is pretty low. The question is asking what else should be done besides encouraging better ART compliance.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the guidelines for HIV patients, especially regarding prophylaxis and vaccinations. A CD4 count of 150 is below 200, so he's likely immunocompromised. Let me think about opportunistic infections. \n\nThe options involve either azithromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) combined with different vaccines. The vaccines mentioned are pneumococcal, zoster, and varicella. \n\nTMP-SMX is a common prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is indicated when CD4 is below 200. Since his CD4 is 150, he should be on PCP prophylaxis. So that points towards options C, D, or E, which include TMP-SMX. \n\nNow, looking at the vaccines. The patient has had the 13vPCV (13-valent) and 23vPPV (23-valent) pneumococcal vaccines before. The guidelines for HIV patients and pneumococcal vaccination can be a bit tricky. For someone who's already had those, do they need another dose? The 23vPPV is a polysaccharide vaccine, and the 13vPCV is conjugate. The current recommendations might suggest revaccination in certain cases, especially if the CD4 is low. Wait, the patient had the 13vPCV 15 years ago and a second 23vPPV 10 years ago. The guidelines might recommend a revaccination with PCV13 again after a certain period, especially in high-risk individuals like those with HIV and low CD4. But I need to check the specifics. \n\nAlternatively, the zoster vaccine: there's the live zoster vaccine (Zostavax) and the newer recombinant (Shingrix). Since the patient is immunocompromised, the live vaccine isn't recommended. Shingrix is the preferred one and",

In the setting of serum hypo-osmolality, urine hyper-osmolality, urine sodium concentration > 20 mEq/L, and hypovolemia (low blood pressure, decreased skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill), this is indicative of cerebral salt wasting.\n\nThe mechanism of cerebral salt wasting is unclear, although some hypotheses point to increased release of brain natriuretic peptide after injury leading to suppression of renal sodium reabsorption, or sympathetic nervous system injury resulting in an impaired renin response. Patients classically present several days after cerebral injury or neurosurgery with hypovolemic hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Water retention results in serum hypo-osmolality, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia with urine hyper-osmolality and increased urine sodium excretion. In patients with prolonged cerebral salt wasting, hypokalemia can also occur (potassium may be normal in acute states). Treatment in mild or moderate cases consists of normal saline infusion to correct both volume status and hyponatremia. Treatment in severe cases consists of hypertonic saline. During correction, serum sodium must be monitored closely to prevent central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nCui et al. describe the differences between syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting. They discuss how volume status serves as the key differentiator between these conditions. They recommend paying closer attention to total body electrolyte balance in understanding these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Addison disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, results in salt wasting due to decreased mineralocorticoid activity. Because of reduced aldosterone release, patients also have hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. In contrast, this patient\u2019s potassium and bicarbonate levels are normal. Treatment is with steroids.\n\nAnswer C: Diuretic overuse is occasionally observed in patients using loop diuretics. Overuse of loop diuretics can cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia. Metabolic alkalosis is commonly seen due to volume contraction. Cerebral salt wasting is more likely in this patient presenting after a recent cerebral injury. Treatment is the cessation of the causative medication.\n\nAnswer D: Primary polydipsia can cause symptomatic hyponatremia. The urine would be maximally diluted (urine osmolality < 100 mEq/L) due to an appropriate physiological response to hyponatremia and excess free water intake. Treatment is cessation of excessive water consumption.\n\nAnswer E: Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) presents with identical findings as cerebral salt wasting with the exception of euvolemia as opposed to hypovolemia. An assessment of volume status is essential to differentiate. This patient has clear signs of hypovolemia. Treatment of SIADH is fluid restriction followed by ADH inhibitors, if needed.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCerebral salt wasting presents with hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hypovolemia in the setting of recent cerebral injury or neurosurgery.",

The patient is a 55-year-old woman who presented with a sudden, severe headache, which is a classic symptom of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The CT scan confirmed the diagnosis, and a CT angiogram found the bleeding source. She underwent surgery. Now, on day 3, she's disoriented and has nausea/vomiting. Her labs show low sodium (120 mEq/L), which is hyponatremia. Let's look at the options.\n\nFirst, the context: SAH can lead to certain complications. The key here is the hyponatremia. The options given are Addison's, cerebral salt wasting (CSW), diuretic overuse, primary polydipsia, and SIADH.\n\nLooking at the lab values: serum osmolality is 265 (low, since normal is around 280-295), and urine osmolality is 340, which is higher than serum. That suggests the kidneys are concentrating urine, so the problem is with too much ADH, leading to water retention. Wait, but let's think again. In SIADH, the urine osmolality is high because the kidneys are retaining water, so the urine is more concentrated than plasma. That's exactly what's here. But wait, the patient is on diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone). Diuretics can cause hyponatremia through different mechanisms. \n\nCerebral salt wasting (CSW) is a condition that can occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage. It's characterized by natriuresis (losing sodium in urine) and volume depletion. The urine sodium would be high (like here, 44), and the patient would be volume depleted. The labs show poor skin turgor and delayed capillary refill, which point to volume depletion. In CSW, the hyponatremia is due to loss of sodium and water, but more sodium than water, leading to low serum sodium. The urine osmolality in CSW would be low because the kidneys are trying to retain water, but in this case, the urine osmolality is higher than serum. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, in SIADH, the urine sodium is typically high (since the kidneys are retaining water, so they excrete more sodium). The urine",

Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure. Further care involves blood pressure control and benzodiazepines as needed to abort seizure episodes (though note that if a patient with preeclampsia is having seizures, by definition, they have eclampsia).\n\nAl-Safi et al. discuss preeclampsia and eclampsia. They note that postpartum preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur within the first week after delivery. They recommend that mothers should be educated on what symptoms to look for.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT head may be indicated, in particular, if an intracranial hemorrhage was thought to be the cause of this patient\u2019s headache and vision changes.

It would be more reasonable to first empirically treat this patient's possible preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer E: Ondansetron and morphine would be appropriate symptomatic management of this patient but would not treat her underlying preeclampsia. It is more appropriate to first treat the life-threatening diagnosis before symptom management.

She also has a headache, blurry vision, and abdominal pain. \n\nFirst, I need to think about possible conditions that could cause such symptoms postpartum. High blood pressure in pregnancy or postpartum can be a sign of preeclampsia or eclampsia. Since she just delivered, eclampsia is a possibility, but she doesn't mention seizures here. However, the symptoms like headache and vision changes are classic for hypertensive emergencies.\n\nThe options given are CT head, Labetalol, Magnesium, MRV head, or Ondansetron and morphine.

But in the context of severe hypertension postpartum, the first step is usually to lower the blood pressure. \n\nB is Labetalol, which is a common antihypertensive used in pregnancy and postpartum for hypertensive crises. It's a vasodilator and beta-blocker, effective in managing blood pressure quickly. \n\nC is Magnesium. That's typically used for seizures in eclampsia or to prevent seizures if she had them. Since she hasn't had a seizure here, maybe not the first choice unless they suspect that's coming. But her symptoms are more about the high BP and possible end-organ damage. \n\nD, MRV head, is a venous angiogram. Not sure why that would be the next step here. Maybe if they thought of a venous sinus thrombosis, but that's less likely than a hypertensive emergency. \n\nE is antiemetic and pain meds. The abdominal pain could be from the uterus contracting, but the priority here is the hypertension. Managing the BP is more critical than the pain or nausea. \n\nThe main issue here is the severe hypertension. The headache and vision changes are warning signs of possible cerebral issues from high BP.

Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin). Though this is a potent antibiotic combination, neither of these takes priority over clindamycin given the possible benefit of toxin suppression from clindamycin.

He was on warfarin for atrial fibrillation and had recent epistaxis. Now he's in the ED again, and the key here is to figure out what's going on and what to administer first.\n\nFirst, the purpuric rash is concerning. That can be a sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or an infection, maybe sepsis. The low blood pressure (64/33) suggests septic shock. The patient was on warfarin, which affects clotting, so maybe there's an underlying infection that's causing both the bleeding and the sepsis. \n\nThe options are all antibiotics, so the question is about which antibiotic to give first in this scenario. The purpura could be from meningococcemia, which is a medical emergency. Meningococcal sepsis presents with a petechial or purpuric rash, hypotension, and can progress rapidly. The treatment for suspected meningococcal infection is typically a third-generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone, but that's not an option here. Alternatively, penicillin is the drug of choice for meningococcus, but I need to check if that's still the case. Wait, but maybe the options given here don't include ceftriaxone.

She had a recent fall, which is a common cause of fractures, especially in older adults, especially with osteoporosis (which can be related to her obesity, but also maybe her vitamin D use? Wait, high-dose vitamin D might actually help bone density, but maybe she's on it for that. However, a fall could cause a fracture. The pain is in the groin, which is a classic location for femoral neck fractures. The crepitus might be a sign of a fracture, but crepitus can also be from arthritis. However, fractures would show up on X-ray. But the question is which is most likely.\n\nOption B: Hyperdense foci in the ureters. That sounds like renal stones. But her history mentions treated acute renal failure. Maybe due to stones before? But the current issue is hip pain. Unless the ibuprofen is causing kidney issues again, but the question is about the hip. Not sure how this relates. Maybe not the right answer.\n\nOption C: Loss of joint space and osteophytes. That's osteoarthritis. She's 69, obese, which are risk factors. The pain that's worse at the end of the day could fit with arthritis (worse with use). The crepitus also suggests joint issues. Osteoarthritis would show joint space narrowing and osteophytes on X-ray. But she had a recent fall. Could the pain be from the fall (fracture) or from underlying arthritis?\n\nOption D: Normal radiography. Unlikely, since she has significant symptoms and crepitus. But maybe if it's early arthritis or a stress fracture not visible yet? But the question says \"most likely.\"\n\nOption E: Posterior displacement of the femoral head. That sounds like a",

This is an ominous finding and suggests a diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) though it may also be seen in other infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis or after ischemic events. ARVD is an autosomal dominant condition where there is fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall predisposing the patient (classically younger patients) to sudden cardiac death from lethal ventricular dysrhythmias. The epsilon wave is the most specific finding; however, other findings include T wave inversion in V1-V3 or a left bundle branch appearance with frequent premature ventricular complexes among other possibilities. This is a potentially lethal diagnosis and requires management with antiarrhythmics (such as beta-blockers or amiodarone) and the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\nKayser et al. review AVRD. They note the presentation and management of ARVD and how it may present initially only with syncope. Cardiac arrest is a possible presentation as well.

It can cause obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. A systolic murmur can be heard on cardiac auscultation and echocardiography can confirm the diagnosis. ECG will demonstrate large voltages in V1-V5.\n\nAnswer D: QT prolongation can lead to torsades des pointes which presents with twisting of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric baseline. It may present with syncope, hemodynamic instability, or cardiac arrest. Medications, infection, and congenital conditions may prolong the QT interval.\n\nAnswer E: Wolff Parkinson White syndrome presents with a delta wave on ECG or a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex.

Since he's asymptomatic otherwise and the exam is normal, maybe a cardiac issue. Let's look at the options.\n\nOption A: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) \u2013 This is a genetic condition causing ventricular arrhythmias, more common in teens/young adults. But it's usually associated with palpitations, syncope, and family history. The kid is 7, which is a bit young, but possible. However, the ECG might show right ventricular issues.\n\nOption B: Brugada syndrome \u2013 This causes ST elevation in V1-V3, can lead to polymorphic VT. It's associated with syncope, especially at rest or sleep. But the patient here is fainting during exercise, which might be less typical. Also, Brugada is more common in males, but age 7 is younger than typical presentation.\n\nOption C: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) \u2013 This is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. It can cause outflow obstruction, leading to syncope during exertion. The ECG might show LVH, Q waves, ST changes. Since he's fainting during basketball, which is strenuous, HOCM is a strong candidate. The echocardiogram is pending, which would show hypertrophy.\n\nOption D: QT prolongation \u2013 Long QT can cause torsades de pointes, leading to syncope, especially with adrenergic stimuli like exercise. But the ECG would show prolonged QT interval. However, the question mentions the ECG is in Figure A, which we can't see. If QT was prolonged, that's a possibility, but maybe less likely if the episodes are brief and without other symptoms.\n\nOption E: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) \u2013 This is an accessory pathway leading to tachycardia.

        "reason": "This patient with a sudden need to void followed by loss of urine with urgency (unable to make it to the bathroom in time) most likely has urinary urge incontinence.\n\nUrge incontinence is a form of urinary incontinence characterized by a sudden urge to urinate, resulting in the involuntary leakage of urine. Normally, bladder contraction occurs due to the stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the detrusor muscle. Urinary urge incontinence is due to detrusor overactivity, leading to a sudden and frequently overwhelming need to void that occurs throughout the day and night. The most common cause is idiopathic, though it may be secondary to neurologic disorders (e.g., spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis), bladder abnormalities, or chronic bladder inflammation. Workup is first centered on ruling out a urinary tract infection with a urinalysis. The diagnosis is made with urodynamic studies, and first-line treatment involves bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. Should first-line treatment of urge incontinence fail, antimuscarinic medications (such as oxybutynin) which reduce acetylcholine activity on muscarinic receptors can decrease detrusor contraction and thus the sense of urgency.\n\nNandy and Ranganathan review urge incontinence. They note that it presents with leakage of urine associated with a sudden urge to urinate. They recommend an appropriate history and workup to first rule out other causes.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer A: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause represents urinary symptoms (stress and/or urge incontinence) due to vaginal dryness and atrophy from menopause. This patient still has menstrual cycles and no symptoms of ovarian follicle depletion (narrowed introitus, vulvovaginal dryness and irritation, irregular vaginal bleeding), making this an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer B: Mixed urinary incontinence presents with features of both stress and urge incontinence. This patient lacks symptoms of stress incontinence given a lack of incontinence with increases in intrabdominal pressure (such as exercise, coughing, laughing, or sneezing).\n\nAnswer C: Overflow incontinence is caused by impaired detrusor muscle activity or bladder outlet obstruction. It presents with constant involuntary dribbling or urine and incomplete bladder emptying. Post-void residual volume is increased in patients with overflow incontinence.\n\nAnswer D: Stress incontinence is caused by urethral hypermobility and otherwise insufficient urethral support. It presents with urinary leakage with activities that increase intraabdominal pressure (such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, and exercising). This patient\u2019s symptoms are unrelated to exercise.\n\nBullet Summary:\nUrge incontinence presents with sudden urinary urgency with a normal post-void residual volume and absence of findings consistent with urinary tract infection.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of three pregnancies and three deliveries. She's been experiencing intermittent urine loss for five months. The key points here are the pattern of her incontinence. The question mentions that the leaking happens throughout the day and night, and she even wakes up to go to the bathroom. But the important part is that exercising doesn't affect it. She also says she can't make it to the bathroom in time once she feels the need to void. \n\nHer last menstrual period was two weeks ago, so she's perimenopausal or menopausal, but we need to see if that's related. The urinalysis is normal, and her postvoid residual is 40 mL, which is within the normal range (usually under 50 mL is considered okay). On pelvic exam, there's no dribbling when she coughs, which would suggest stress incontinence. \n\nSo, let's go through the options. \n\nOption A: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause. That's related to menopause symptoms like vaginal atrophy, dyspareunia, maybe some urinary symptoms like urgency, but would that explain incontinence? Maybe, but the key here is the type of incontinence. \n\nOption B: Mixed urinary incontinence is a combination of stress and urge. But the question says that when she coughs (a stress test), there's no dribbling, so stress component might not be there. \n\nOption C: Overflow incontinence is when the bladder doesn't empty properly, leading to constant dribbling. But her postvoid residual is normal (40 mL), so overflow is less likely. Overflow is often due to obstruction or a noncontractile bladder. \n\nOption D: Stress incontinence is leakage with increased abdominal pressure like coughing, sneezing, exercise. But the question states that exercising doesn't affect it, and the cough test was negative. So probably not D. \n\nOption E: Urge incontinence is the strong need to urinate followed by involuntary loss. The patient mentions she can't make it to the bathroom once she feels the need, which is classic for urge incontinence (overactive bladder). The fact that it happens day and night, including waking up, also points towards urge. \n\nSo putting it all together: no stress component (since coughing didn't cause leakage and exercise isn't a trigger),",

He has 3-5 drinks of scotch per night before working on his car. On physical exam, the tremor is replicated during finger to nose testing. Romberg sign is negative. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with a tremor that only occurs during terminal activity and is likely improved by alcohol (hence why he drinks prior to working on the car) has benign essential tremor. This is best treated with propranolol.\n\nBenign essential tremor is a type of rhythmic oscillatory movement that occurs with posturing and action. The pathophysiology of this disorder is unclear; however, it classically gets worse with actions that require terminal positioning of the extremities such as pouring a drink or pointing a television remote. The tremor improves with alcohol consumption so patients will often self-medicate with alcoholic drinks. There is a strong genetic component, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. The best method of replicating the tremor is with the finger-nose-finger test because this requires the patient to perform a precise activity at a terminal distance. The diagnosis is made clinically. Treatment is with propranolol or primidone, which are both considered first-line agents although the latter has less evidence for its efficacy.\n\nPaparella et al. studied the effects of propranolol on head and upper extremity movements in patients with benign essential tremors. They found that this medication has no effect on head movements but reduces the number of upper extremity tremors in these patients. They recommended that agents other than propranolol should be used for the treatment of head tremors in these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alcoholics anonymous is the first-line treatment for patients with alcohol use disorder; however, the tremors that occur during alcohol withdrawal are not isolated to movements during terminal activities. Alcohol withdrawal also presents with other signs including restlessness, diaphoresis, and insomnia. More severe cases can present with hallucinations and seizures. The response of this patient's tremor to alcohol consumption is typical of patients with benign essential tremor.\n\nAnswer B: Aripiprazole and other atypical antipsychotic medications can be used in patients with Tourette syndrome; however, these patients will present with involuntary tics rather than a tremor that only occurs during a voluntary activity at the terminal range of motion. Moreover, for the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome, both motor and phonic tics must be present.\n\nAnswer C: Carbidopa can be used in the treatment of Parkinson disease; however, the tremor associated with this disease classically occurs at rest and is described in character as a \"pill-rolling\" tremor. The other features of Parkinson disease include bradykinesia or akinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.\n\nAnswer D: Phenobarbital can be used in the treatment of Huntington disease; however, the involuntary movements seen in this disease are classically choreiform rather than intention tremor. Huntington disease presents with chorea, psychiatric illness, and depression. There is commonly a strong genetic predisposition, as it is a trinucleotide repeat disorder that exhibits anticipation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPropranolol can be used in the treatment of patients with benign essential tremor, which presents with an action tremor that is alleviated by alcohol use.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 51-year-old man with a tremor noticed by his wife. His father had Parkinson's, which might be a clue. The tremor occurs during specific activities like pouring drinks or using tools, which are purposeful movements. The physical exam shows the tremor during finger-to-nose testing, and Romberg is negative. His meds include lisinopril, metformin, atorvastatin, and he drinks 3-5 scotches nightly before working on his car.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what kind of tremor this is. Parkinson's tremor is typically at rest, like when the hands are in the lap. But here, the tremor happens during activity, which suggests it's an action tremor. Essential tremor is a common cause of action tremors, especially if there's a family history. Since his father had Parkinson's, maybe there's a genetic component, but the tremor type here doesn't fit Parkinson's. Essential tremor can be familial too.\n\nThe options are: AA (alcoholics anonymous), aripiprazole (antipsychotic), carbidopa (Parkinson's med), phenobarbital (sedative), and propranolol (beta-blocker). \n\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker often used for essential tremor. Alcohol can sometimes reduce tremors, but the patient is drinking before working, which might be self-medicating. However, his alcohol use might be problematic given the quantity, but the question is about treating the tremor. \n\nCarbidopa is part of Parkinson's treatment (usually with levodopa), but since the tremor isn't at rest, maybe not. Aripiprazole can be used for tremors in some cases, like in PD or ET, but propranolol is first-line for ET. Phenobarbital might be for seizures, not typically tremor. AA would address alcoholism, but the question is about the tremor treatment. \n\nSo the most appropriate treatment here is propranolol (E). The patient's tremor is likely essential tremor, and propranolol is the standard treatment. Even though he drinks alcohol, which can temporarily reduce tremors, the correct treatment is the beta-blocker.\n</think>\n\nE",

It is thought to be due to a bacterial overgrowth/infection that then damages the intestinal mucosa. Endemic areas include the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and South India. Patients present with chronic diarrhea, abdominal discomfort/cramps, progressive weight loss, and clinical features of malabsorption. Patients with tropical sprue can develop megaloblastic anemia (low hemoglobin and elevated MCV) from a deficiency in folate and vitamin B12 absorption.

A small intestine biopsy can similarly show villous atrophy and a lymphocytic infiltrate, as well as crypt hyperplasia. Celiac disease is an immune response to gluten, while symptoms of tropical sprue are not diet-associated. The development of symptoms following significant travel (lasting at least several weeks) to an endemic country should raise suspicion for tropical sprue.\n\nAnswer B: Crohn disease presents with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, skip lesions anywhere from mouth to anus, extraintestinal manifestations, and signs of malabsorption. A biopsy will show transmural inflammation with noncaseating granulomas, giant cells, and aggregates of lymphocytes in the lamina propria.\n\nAnswer C: Giardia is a parasite that is endemic in the tropics and North American mountain regions. Patients present with foul-smelling diarrhea, excessive gas, and nausea. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a stool analysis or immunoassay. Though a biopsy is normally not indicated, it would show mild lymphocytic infiltration and Giardia trophozoites on the intestinal surface.\n\nAnswer E: Whipple disease is caused by the bacteria Tropheryma whipplei.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with what appears to be anorexia nervosa (thin habitus, possible excessive exercise in the setting of marathon running, thinning hair, dry mucous membranes, decreased free T4 level, and multiple electrolyte derangements). The lack of improvement in either her muscle spasms with fluid repletion or her hypokalemia with adequate repletion, even in the setting of normal serum magnesium, suggests depleted magnesium stores are the underlying etiology of her symptoms.\n\nHypomagnesemia typically occurs in alcoholics, malnourished patients, and patients with eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Patients may present with a wide array of symptoms including weakness, confusion, dysrhythmias, hypotension, and overall malaise. Hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia as magnesium is needed for proper parathyroid hormone secretion. Another pathognomonic finding associated with hypomagnesemia is hypokalemia which is refractory to repletion. The pathophysiology is thought to be due to increased potassium wasting in the kidney due to increased activity of renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels. The serum magnesium level should be checked and repletion should occur accordingly. Serum magnesium levels represent 1% or less of total body magnesium stores and do not reflect if a patient truly has hypomagnesemia, particularly if there is intracellular depletion (such as in chronically malnourished patients). Thus, any patient with findings consistent with hypomagnesemia with normal serum magnesium should have their other electrolytes repleted and be given magnesium. Magnesium repletion is a safe intervention with a wide therapeutic index, and the serum level often does not correlate with total body stores.\n\nRazzaque discusses the relationship between serum magnesium levels and total body magnesium status. The author finds that inadequate magnesium balance is associated with myriad disorders including skeletal deformities, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. The author recommends the use of the magnesium loading test to provide more accurate reflections of total body magnesium status.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hypocalcemia may present with perioral numbness, paresthesias, and muscle spasms. It can occur secondary to poor nutrition, vitamin D deficiency, and hypoparathyroidism. Low serum calcium may also be seen in patients with low albumin and in states of hyperventilation (which lowers the free calcium but not the total calcium due to a respiratory alkalosis that causes albumin to bind free calcium and release protons). Hypomagnesemia can also cause hypocalcemia as magnesium is needed for proper parathyroid hormone release.\n\nAnswer C: Hyponatremia may present with malaise, nausea, vomiting, headache, and confusion. Patients may also be asymptomatic in mild cases. Asymptomatic patients with hyponatremia and functioning kidneys require only fluid restriction. On the other hand, severe hyponatremia presents with very low sodium (often < 120 mEq/L) and neurological symptoms such as profound confusion or seizures. Treatment with hypertonic saline would be indicated in this situation.\n\nAnswer D: Hypothyroidism presents with fatigue, malaise, weight gain, bradycardia, scarce lanugo, and depression. This patient\u2019s TSH is on the high end of normal and her T4 is lower than the cutoff value. However, this is likely a compensatory response to her low BMI and excessive exercise in order to slow down her metabolism to conserve energy.\n\nAnswer E: Hypovolemia was certainly present in this patient given her dry mucous membranes and prerenal pattern of labs (BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1). After receiving 4L of fluids, it is clear that dehydration is not the cause of her symptoms as her BUN corrects and her symptoms persist. In general, hypovolemia should be treated with oral rehydration, if possible.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia and hypokalemia refractory to repletion (a normal serum level does not indicate normal intracellular levels of magnesium).",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 33-year-old woman presenting with muscle spasms, fatigue, and some physical exam findings like thinning hair and pallor. Her lab results show a few key abnormalities. Let's go through the labs first.\n\nLooking at the electrolytes: her potassium is really low at 2.3 mEq/L, which is a classic cause of muscle cramps and weakness. But she's been given potassium supplements, and after two doses, her potassium only went up to 2.5. That's still low, and the muscle spasms are still there. Hmm, maybe there's another issue causing the potassium to stay low despite supplementation. \n\nThe other electrolytes: her sodium is 130, which is on the low side but not critically low. Chloride is 100, which is within normal range. BUN was initially 40, which came down to 20 after fluids, so maybe she was dehydrated before? But the BUN dropped a lot with the IV fluids, so maybe that was part of the issue. But the main problem here is the persistent hypokalemia.\n\nHer calcium is 8.2, which is within the normal range (usually 8.5-10.2, but maybe the lab's normal is a bit different? Wait, the options include hypocalcemia, but her Ca is 8.2. Let me check the normal range. Wait, the question doesn't provide the normal ranges for each lab, but the options are given. The calcium here is 8.2, which might be low if the normal is higher. But the question mentions that her Mg is 1.8 mg/dL. The normal Mg is usually around 1.5-2.5, so 1.8 is just within the lower end. Wait, but maybe she's actually low in magnesium? Wait, the Mg here is 1.8, which is within the normal range. Wait, the options include hypomagnesemia. Wait, maybe the Mg is low? Let me think again. The normal Mg levels are typically 1.5-2.5 mg/dL, so 1.8 is within that. Hmm, so maybe not hypomagnesemia. Wait, but maybe the patient has a magnesium deficiency that's not showing up in the initial labs? Or perhaps the Mg is low but the lab",

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients.

The key findings here are the 4+ blood in the urine and dark-colored urine. The ECG is mentioned but not shown, so maybe the answer doesn't rely on that. \n\nFirst, the confusion and dark urine with hematuria (4+ blood) make me think of rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdo can cause myoglobinuria, which darkens the urine. The generalized pain could be muscle aches from rhabdo. But what causes rhabdomyolysis in an elderly person? Maybe a fall leading to muscle injury, but she was found on the floor\u2014could be a prolonged lie on the floor leading to pressure-induced muscle damage. Alternatively, medications like statins, but the question doesn't mention that. \n\nAnother possibility is acute kidney injury from another cause, but the dark urine and hematuria point more towards myoglobin. The next step in management for rhabdomyolysis is usually aggressive IV fluids to maintain urine output and prevent kidney damage. Let's look at the options. \n\nOption D is IV fluid resuscitation.

But the most immediate step for rhabdo is fluids. \n\nAlternatively, if the ECG shows something like peaked T waves (hyperkalemia), then calcium gluconate (B) would be first. But without seeing the ECG, maybe the question is pointing towards the urinalysis findings. \n\nThe dipstick shows 4+ blood and dark urine.

Most umbilical hernias in children resolve spontaneously and can be managed expectantly.\n\nAn umbilical hernia is a protrusion of bowel, omentum, or preperitoneal fat through the umbilical ring that can change in size with increases in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., crying). The majority of umbilical hernias in patients under 5 years of age resolve spontaneously. The indications for surgery on umbilical hernias in that age group are limited to incarcerated hernias or hernias > 1.5 cm in diameter. Incarcerated hernias present with an irreducible mass that is associated with pain and erythema. Surgical closure may be considered in patients whose defects fail to close by the age of 5.\n\nChirdan et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with an incarcerated umbilical hernia. They discuss how most patients with hernias resolve spontaneously before 5 years of age but a small number will have incarcerated hernias that require surgery earlier. They recommend active observation of patients to diagnose incarceration earlier.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Elective surgical management later on in childhood is usually not required to manage umbilical hernias as most umbilical hernias in patients less than 5 years of age close spontaneously. Hernias that persist past age 5 can be closed surgically in an elective fashion.\n\nAnswer C: Histopathologic evaluation would be the most appropriate next step in management if the patient had an unknown umbilical mass, such as an umbilical granuloma or polyp. Umbilical granulomas form shortly after birth from excess tissue at the base of the umbilicus and can be treated topically, whereas umbilical polyps are firm masses of omphalomesenteric duct or urachal embryologic remnants and require surgical excision.\n\nAnswer D: Immediate surgical management is required in patients with incarcerated hernias, but this patient\u2019s hernia is easily reducible and < 1.5 cm.

They occur when the muscles around the belly button don't close completely, allowing part of the intestine to protrude. The key points here are that it's reducible (can be pushed back), no pain, no redness or drainage, and the size is small. \n\nThe options are about management. The choices are elective surgery, expectant, histopathology, immediate surgery, or thyroid hormone. \n\nI remember that most umbilical hernias in infants are managed expectantly because they often resolve on their own by age 2-5 years. Surgery is usually considered if it's large, doesn't go away by age 4-5, or if there's complications like incarceration. Since this one is small, reducible, and no signs of infection or obstruction, the next step is just to watch it. Elective surgery isn't needed unless it's persistent. Immediate surgery is for when there's a risk of strangulation, but here there's no signs of that. Histopathology would be if they suspected a mass or tumor, but the description doesn't indicate that.

The most important risk factor is smoking. This tumor causes compression of adjacent structures. Patients can present with severe, localized axilla pain (due to invasion of the brachial plexus), weakness of intrinsic hand muscles with radicular pain and paresthesias in the fourth and fifth digits (due to invasion of the C8-T1 portion of the brachial plexus), Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and facial anhidrosis due to invasion of the cervical sympathetic nerves), hoarseness (due to invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve), and edema of the arm with facial swelling (due to compression of the superior vena cava).

He quit smoking and drinking over seven years ago.\n\nFirst, the symptoms: hemoptysis and shortness of breath point towards a pulmonary issue. The weight loss and smoking history make malignancy a big concern. The shoulder pain could be related to metastasis, maybe from lung cancer.

The lack of pain with shoulder movement suggests it's not a rotator cuff issue (option C). \n\nThe Horner's syndrome (miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis) here is indicated by the pupillary constriction. Horner's can be caused by a lesion in the cervical sympathetic pathway. Lung tumors, especially Pancoast tumors (which are usually lung cancers like adenocarcinoma), can compress the sympathetic nerves leading to Horner's syndrome.

Leiomyomas increase the risk of iron deficiency anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\nLeiomyoma are benign overgrowths of myometrial tissue. The most common presentation is heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding or symptoms related to mass effect such as pelvic pressure or pain.. Affected women often develop these symptoms in their 30s or 40s, though they may occur at any age, and many are asymptomatic. Risk factors include early menarche, obesity, family history, and African American race. Submucosal fibroids that disrupt the endometrium may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Intramural fibroids also commonly cause heavy bleeding despite the fact that they do not disrupt the endometrium due to alterations in the uterine vasculature. Patients may be managed medically with a wide range of options including oral contraceptive pills, tranexamic acid, and GnRH agonists. Definitive management is with surgical intervention. Myomectomy is preferred for patients that desire child bearing in the future. For those that do not have plans for pregnancy in the future, hysterectomy is recommended.\n\nYang et. al review the diagnosis and management of uterine fibroids. They note the range of clinical presentations to include heavy menstrual bleeding. They discuss management to include surgical intervention with myomectomy or hysterectomy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amenorrhea, or the absence of menstrual bleeding, is often due to anovulation or uterine adhesions. Uterine fibroids are not associated with amenorrhea.\n\nAnswer B: Endometrial cancer is a known cause of heavy menstrual bleeding. However, this patient\u2019s ultrasound notes the presence of intramural leiomyomas. Her age, history, and ultrasound findings are not suggestive of endometrial cancer.\n\nAnswer D: Uterine prolapse is associated with multiparity, chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure (from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, etc.), and connective tissue diseases. While fibroids rarely may prolapse, they typically do not cause the entire uterus to prolapse.\n\nAnswer E: Uterine sarcoma may very rarely result from uterine fibroids, as both arise from the uterine smooth muscle. However, this patient\u2019s history and ultrasound findings are more suggestive of uterine leiomyoma.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) are at risk for iron deficiency anemia due to heavy bleeding.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of hypertension managed by hydrochlorothiazide. Her BMI is 32.4, which is in the obese range. She has a family history of breast cancer (mother) and endometriosis (sister). The key part here is the pelvic exam finding: a non-tender, 12-week-size uterus with an irregular contour, and the ultrasound showing two intramural leiomyomas. The question is asking about a likely complication of her condition, which in this case is uterine leiomyomas, commonly known as fibroids.\n\nSo, the options are Amenorrhea, Endometrial cancer, Iron deficiency anemia, Uterine prolapse, and Uterine sarcoma. Let's go through each option.\n\nFirst, intramural fibroids are within the muscular wall of the uterus. Common complications of fibroids include things like menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding), which can lead to iron deficiency anemia (option C). That's a common one because heavy periods over time can cause blood loss leading to anemia. \n\nAmenorrhea (A) is the absence of menstruation. Fibroids might cause heavy periods but not typically stop them entirely unless there's some other issue, so maybe not the most likely.\n\nEndometrial cancer (B) \u2013 fibroids themselves aren't directly linked to endometrial cancer. However, obesity is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. But the question is about complications of the fibroids. Unless the fibroids cause something else, like irregular bleeding that might be confused, but the direct link isn't strong here. The patient's BMI is high, but the question is about the leiomyomas' complications.\n\nUterine prolapse (D) can occur when the uterus descends into the vagina, often due to weak pelvic muscles. Fibroids can increase the weight of the uterus, potentially contributing to prolapse, especially if they are large. The uterus here is 12 weeks in size, which is bigger than normal, so that's a possibility. But is it a common complication? I think heavy bleeding leading to anemia is more common than prolapse as a first-line complication.\n\nUterine sarcoma (E) is a malignant tumor of the uterus, but leiomyomas are benign. While there's a very rare chance of a leiomyoma turning malignant (leiomyosarcoma),",

An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block. Note the left axis deviation as suggested by the net upward deflection of the QRS in lead I and net downward deflection in lead II (blue arrows).

It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection.

An ECG was done (Figure A not shown), and after 2L oral fluids, he's better.\n\nThe question is asking which condition is most likely to occur based on his history and ECG. The options are atrial fibrillation, complete heart block, MI, stroke, or torsades de pointes.\n\nFirst, let's think about the scenario. He was in a hot, humid environment, didn't drink water, leading to possible dehydration. Fainting upon standing suggests orthostatic hypotension. Dehydration can lead to hypovolemia, which can cause a drop in blood pressure when standing, leading to fainting. The fact that he was given fluids and improved supports that. \n\nNow, the ECG is important here. The options include arrhythmias. The question is which arrhythmia is more likely in this context. Let's consider each option:\n\nA. Atrial fibrillation: Typically presents with irregular rhythm, rapid heart rate, maybe palpitations. But in this case, the patient's pulse was 86, which is normal. AFib might cause tachycardia, but not sure. Also, the cause here seems more related to dehydration and possible electrolyte imbalance.\n\nB. Complete heart block: This would lead to bradycardia, maybe symptoms like dizziness, syncope. But his pulse is 86, which is normal. Complete heart block usually has a very slow heart rate. So maybe not.\n\nC. Myocardial infarction: He has hypertension, a risk factor. But the presentation here is more about fainting from possible dehydration. The ECG might show ischemic changes, but the patient's recovery with fluids and normal neuro exam makes MI less likely unless there's chest pain or other symptoms. The question doesn't mention chest pain, so",

Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin is an appropriate initial regimen.\n\nMalignant otitis externa is an invasive infection of the external auditory canal and skull base, and is seen almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients. Patients with poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus are at particularly increased risk. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues including the bones at the base of the skull and the temporomandibular joint. The resulting skull base osteomyelitis distinguishes the \"necrotizing\" or \"malignant\" presentation of otitis externa. Patients often present with severe otalgia and purulent drainage from the external auditory canal. Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal is a characteristic exam finding. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the causative organism in most cases of necrotizing otitis externa. Therefore, intravenous antibiotics with sufficient coverage of Pseudomonas are the therapy of choice. As infection progresses, involvement of cranial nerves with resultant palsy may be observed.\n\nAaraj et. al review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of malignant otitis externa.

His history includes diabetes and hypertension, which are important because diabetes can lead to infections that are harder to treat. The physical exam shows granulation tissue and purulent drainage in the external auditory canal, and he looks toxic.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on here. The symptoms point towards an infection. The key here is the location\u2014external auditory canal. The presence of granulation tissue and purulent discharge makes me think of external otitis, which can be caused by bacteria or fungi. But given the foul smell and the systemic symptoms like fever and chills, it's more likely a bacterial infection. \n\nWait, but there's also the possibility of malignant otitis externa, which is a severe infection that can spread to the bone, especially in diabetics. That's a serious condition and might require stronger antibiotics. The patient's diabetes puts him at higher risk for such infections. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA) Acyclovir is an antiviral, so probably not unless it's herpes zoster, but the symptoms don't point to that. \n\nB) Amoxicillin is a common antibiotic, but maybe not broad enough. \n\nC) Ceftriaxone is a third-gen cephalosporin, which is IV, so maybe for more severe cases. \n\nD) Ofloxacin ear drops are topical fluoroquinolones.

Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma. They discuss how patients often sustain these injuries from extreme sports. They recommend being aware of this syndrome so that acute interventions can be taken.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a biconvex hyperdensity that is limited by suture lines (red circle). This is the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma on head CT.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins results in a subdural hematoma (SDH). An acute SDH more commonly presents with a gradual increase in headache and confusion rather than the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome presented in this vignette. However, a minority of patients with acute SDH may have a lucid interval followed by progressive neurological decline. SDH would have a crescent-shaped appearance on head CT rather than the biconvex appearance of an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries describes a lacunar stroke. Although this patient has 2 risk factors for lacunar stroke (hypertension and smoking), this patient\u2019s head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer D: A ruptured cerebral aneurysm would most likely lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap headache\u201d), confusion or somnolence, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Surgical clipping or embolization of the bleeding vessel may be required.\n\nAnswer E: Secondary hemorrhage into a prior area of infarction usually occurs in the setting of a recent embolic stroke. Although this patient has a history of TIA and other risk factors for stroke, his head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma. Treatment is supportive with the control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nBullet Summary:\nEpidural hematomas are caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery as it passes through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone.",

The patient is a 54-year-old man who had a skiing accident, hit a tree, lost consciousness briefly, then became more confused. He was initially alert (GCS 15) but in the ER his GCS dropped to 7. His history includes hypertension, CAD, prior TIA, on statins and lisinopril. The head CT is mentioned but we can't see it. The options are about possible causes.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the mechanism of injury (blunt trauma to the head), the initial GCS of 15 but then deterioration. The fact that he was hit by a tree suggests a possible traumatic brain injury. The confusion and drop in GCS over time is concerning. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Damage to cerebral bridging veins: That sounds like a subdural hematoma. Bridging veins are stretched in the elderly, but he's 54, maybe not as common. But trauma can cause it. Subdural hematomas can have a delayed presentation, so the symptoms getting worse hours later fits.\n\nB) Damage to the sphenoid bone: The sphenoid is a skull bone, but how does that cause neurological decline? Maybe a fracture, but not directly linked to the GCS drop unless there's associated brain injury. Not the most likely.\n\nC) Occlusion of small penetrating arteries: That would be a lacunar stroke. But he had a head injury. However, his history includes a prior TIA and hypertension, which are risk factors. But the timing after trauma makes me think trauma-related injury is more likely. But could a stroke be possible? Maybe, but the question is about the most likely cause given the scenario.\n\nD) Ruptured cerebral aneurysm: Subarachnoid hemorrhage. But that's usually from aneurysm rupture, which can be spontaneous or due to trauma. The mechanism here is trauma, so a traumatic aneurysm rupture is possible, but maybe less common than a subdural or epidural?\n\nE) Secondary hemorrhage into prior infarct: He had a prior TIA, so maybe an old infarct area. If there was an ischemic area that later bled, that's a hemorrhagic transformation. But that usually occurs in the setting of an ischemic stroke, so if he had a TIA, maybe a small infarct that then bled",

A digital rectal exam may temporarily relieve the obstruction and lead to the expulsion of gas and stool (the \u201csquirt sign\u201d). Abdominal radiography typically demonstrates signs of distal intestinal obstruction such as proximal dilation and an absence of air in the rectum. Contrast enema may reveal a transition zone between the dilated proximal megacolon and the narrow rectosigmoid colon. A biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with surgical removal of the defective segment of the bowel.\n\nKessman reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Hirschsprung disease. She discusses how the diagnosis can be made using a rectal suction biopsy.

This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Duodenal atresia is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and may also present in the first 48 hours of life with bilious vomiting. The abdominal radiograph will demonstrate the \u201cdouble bubble\u201d sign, which reflects air trapping in the stomach and first portion of the duodenum. Treatment is with the surgical opening of the atretic segment.\n\nAnswer C: Intestinal malrotation may preset with bilious vomiting in a neonate due to the development of a midgut volvulus. An abdominal radiograph may show the extension of the nasogastric tube into an abnormally positioned duodenum and would not show diffuse colonic distension. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the volvulus.\n\nAnswer D: Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and also presents with delayed (> 48 hours) passing of meconium. The distal obstruction in these patients will not be temporarily relieved by a digital rectal exam. Contrast enema will demonstrate microcolon involving the entire large bowel. Treatment is with irrigation and removal of the meconium.\n\nAnswer E: Pyloric stenosis usually presents in the first 3-6 weeks of life with post-prandial, nonbilious, projectile vomiting and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium.

The physical exam findings include upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, and a single palmar crease\u2014those are features of Down syndrome. \n\nNow, considering the options: Duodenal atresia (A) often presents with bilious vomiting early on, and sometimes associated with Down syndrome. Hirschsprung (B) is about aganglionic colon, leading to distal obstruction, but the baby here had some stool after rectal exam, so maybe not. Intestinal malrotation (C) can cause midgut volvulus, but that's more common a bit later, and the symptoms might be more acute. Meconium ileus (D) is seen in cystic fibrosis, but the baby is 37 weeks, and meconium ileus usually presents with failure to pass meconium and distension. Pyloric stenosis (E) typically presents around 3-6 weeks with non-bilious projectile vomiting.\n\nThe key points here are the bright green vomitus (bile), no stool until the rectal exam, and the physical features suggesting Down syndrome. Duodenal atresia is common in Down syndrome and presents with bilious vomiting and failure to pass meconium. The abdominal X-ray would show a double bubble sign (stomach and duodenal dilation).

Primary amenorrhea is caused by either hypothalamic/pituitary (central) or gonadal (peripheral) abnormalities. Increased FSH indicates a peripheral cause or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Karyotyping would be the most appropriate next diagnostic step because these disorders can include Turner syndrome and androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\nGravholt et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Turner syndrome. They discuss how this disease presents with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. They recommend growth hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy in these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CYP17 gene work-up should be done in patients with primary amenorrhea, an absence of secondary sex characteristics, elevated FSH, and hypertension. Alterations in the CYP17 gene can cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17-hydroxylase deficiency. The resulting excess of deoxycorticosterone is associated with hypertension and hypokalemia. Treatment is with hormone repletion therapy.\n\nAnswer B: Estrogen levels would be low in this patient as evidenced by her absence of breast development. Therefore, measuring estrogen levels would provide no additional diagnostic information. Estrogen levels may be useful in cases of peripheral gonadotropin resistance but these are rare.\n\nAnswer C: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test would be the next diagnostic step if FSH were decreased. A decrease in FSH indicates a central cause or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. A GnRH stimulation test is used to assess whether the central abnormality is due to the hypothalamus or the pituitary.\n\nAnswer E: Luteinizing hormone (LH) levels with a repeat FSH level may be helpful if FSH is low or normal. Low or normal FSH levels indicate hypogonadotropic hypogonadism as caused by hypothalamic-pituitary axis abnormalities. Cases of high FSH represent a different diagnostic entity as adequate gonadotropins are produced.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient with primary amenorrhea and an increased FSH, the next step in management is karyotyping.",

Her family history shows her sister started at 14 and her mom at 13, so that's a bit concerning since she's already a year past the family average. But she's healthy otherwise, plays basketball, and has a normal BMI. The physical exam shows no breast development and Tanner stage 1 for genitalia. The serum FSH is 38 mIU/mL, which is high because normal FSH levels in prepubertal girls are usually lower. Elevated FSH along with absent puberty points towards primary amenorrhea, possibly due to a problem with the ovaries, like Turner syndrome or premature ovarian insufficiency.\n\nThe options given are CYP17 gene work-up, estrogen levels, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test, karyotype, or luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. \n\nFirst, high FSH suggests that the ovaries aren't responding, so the pituitary is trying to stimulate them by releasing more FSH. In primary amenorrhea with high FSH, the next step is often to check for chromosomal abnormalities like Turner syndrome, which is a common cause. A karyotype would detect that. \n\nThe CYP17 gene is related to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but that usually presents with other signs like ambiguous genitalia, which she doesn't have. Estrogen levels might be low, but since FSH is already high, that's more about ovarian function. The GnRH stimulation test is used when FSH is normal or low to see if the pituitary is functioning. Since her FSH is high, that test isn't needed here. LH levels might be elevated too, but checking both FSH and LH together can help, but the question already provided FSH. The key here is that high FSH points to primary ovarian failure, so the next step is a karyotype to check for Turner syndrome (45,XO), which is a common cause of primary amenorrhea with high FSH.

There are other screening tests for a patient concerned about aneuploidy; however, only CVS and amniocentesis offer definitive diagnoses. Complications of this procedure include pregnancy loss (at a rate of 1-2%), transverse limb abnormality, rupture of membranes, and chorioamnionitis. Patients should also have counseling if genetic abnormalities are detected using this procedure.\n\nFarina reviews the evidence regarding the complications associated with CVS. He discusses how this procedure is becoming more common as the definitive method of providing an early diagnosis. He recommends being aware of complications such as possible pregnancy loss.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amniocentesis is a useful tool for the definitive diagnosis of aneuploidy and other genetic conditions. Due to the higher rate of fetal loss at younger gestational ages, it is reserved for those above 14 weeks.\n\nAnswer B: The anatomy ultrasound can be helpful in identifying morphologic features that are concerning for Down syndrome, such as a flat nasal bridge or an echogenic cardiac focus. This screening tool is most accurate after 18 weeks gestation.\n\nAnswer D: Genetic testing of the patient\u2019s sister may be able to help identify if there is a parental translocation or aneuploidy that led to the child\u2019s Down syndrome. This is much less likely than meiotic nondisjunction due to advanced maternal age, and this would not help diagnose Down syndrome in the patient\u2019s fetus.\n\nAnswer E: The nuchal translucency test examines the thickness of the nuchal fold. When the thickness exceeds normal measurements, there is an increased risk of aneuploidy such as Down syndrome, but this is a screening result that would not provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nChorionic villus sampling is a definitive method of identifying aneuploidy in fetuses starting at 10 weeks of gestational age.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 36-year-old woman at 10 weeks and 2 days gestation. She's concerned about Down syndrome because her sister had an affected child. Her history includes anxiety and atopic dermatitis, and she's on escitalopram. The question is about the best next step to definitively determine if the fetus has Down syndrome.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the options for prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The options given are amniocentesis, anatomy ultrasound, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), genetic testing of her sister, and nuchal translucency test.\n\nThe key points here are the gestational age (10 weeks 2 days) and the need for a definitive test. Definitive tests are invasive procedures like amniocentesis or CVS, which provide chromosomal analysis. Non-invasive options like nuchal translucency are screening tests, not diagnostic.\n\nAt 10 weeks, CVS is typically done between 10-13 weeks, so that's within range. Amniocentesis is usually done later, around 15-20 weeks. Since she's only 10 weeks, CVS would be the earliest option here. The nuchal translucency is part of the first-trimester screening (combined with blood tests) for Down syndrome, but it's a screening test, not diagnostic. The anatomy ultrasound is more for structural anomalies at around 18-22 weeks. \n\nThe patient's sister having a child with Down syndrome might indicate a familial risk, but genetic testing on the sister wouldn't directly determine the current fetus's status. The main concern is the patient's own fetus. Since she's early in pregnancy, CVS would be the most appropriate definitive test at this stage. Amniocentesis would come later. So the answer should be C, chorionic villus sampling.\n</think>\n\nC",

Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The case is about a newborn with a scalp swelling that appeared after a vacuum-assisted delivery. The question is asking which space or potential space is affected here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the layers of the scalp and the different types of scalp hematomas. The scalp has several layers: skin, subcutaneous tissue, galea aponeurotica, loose connective tissue, and periosteum. The different hematomas are named based on where they occur between these layers.\n\nThe key here is the timing and the location. The baby had a vacuum-assisted delivery, which can cause trauma leading to hematomas. The swelling is described as diffuse, ecchymotic, over the parietal bones, and not changing in size over 12 hours. \n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nOption A: Between dura and arachnoid mater. That's the subdural space. A subdural hematoma would involve the dura and arachnoid. But subdural hematomas in newborns can occur from birth trauma, but they might be more associated with bleeding between the dura and the brain's surface. However, the question mentions the swelling is in the scalp, so maybe not this one.\n\nOption B: Between periosteum and galea aponeurosis. That's a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematomas are blood collections between the periosteum (which is attached to the skull bone) and the galea. They typically develop after birth, can take weeks to resolve, and their borders are confined to a single bone since the periosteum is attached to the bone. The question mentions the swelling is over bilateral parietal bones. Wait, but the periosteum is separate for each bone, so a cephalohematoma can't cross suture lines. If it's bilateral parietal, maybe that's an issue? Hmm, maybe I need to think again. Wait, the question says \"bilateral parietal bones\" but the periosteum is on each bone. So maybe the description here is a bit conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a large area that spans, but maybe the answer is still B because that's the typical space for a cephalohematoma. But let me check other options.\n\nOption C: Between periosteum and skull. That would be within the perioste",

To determine the underlying cause, a root cause analysis to determine the underlying issue is the most appropriate way to begin to address this issue.\n\nWhen a problem is found in healthcare, it is important to elucidate the underlying cause. A root cause analysis is the current preferred method of determining the underlying cause of a problem. A root cause analysis outlines all the people, materials, equipment, and processes in place and outlines them. It then locates the problem and attempts to find the breakdown or issue in all these inputs that lead to the problem. Once the problem is identified, then a strategy or intervention can be implemented to fix the underlying problem.\n\nPercarpio et al. review root cause analysis. They note the ubiquity of root cause analysis. They call into question its cost and efficacy despite it being such a widespread practice and recommend a careful assessment of the costs and benefits.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Automatically consulting neurology for patients with concerning neurologic symptoms may be appropriate if the issue was lack of access to timely neurologist assessment in the workup of stroke. While may hospitals have this as a default for patients with stroke-like symptoms, it would be premature to implement this as a solution without a root cause analysis to first determine what the problem is.\n\nAnswer B: Empirically scanning patients with concerning neurologic symptoms would be wasteful and not plausible in a healthcare system. There are many concerning neurologic chief complaints including those that originate in the brain, the spine, or the peripheral nerves; thus, merely CT scanning everyone with a neurological chief complaint is an inefficient use of resources.\n\nAnswer C: Improving resident education is assuming that the problem is a lack of knowledge based on the residents. Before proposing a solution, it is important to first find the underlying cause and address said cause as the delayed intervention may not be the fault of the residents.\n\nAnswer E: A systems-based approach is the best solution when fixing a medical error. However, a root cause analysis is first needed to determine which solution is needed. If an error in the process is noted, a systems-based approach would be the best method to address it.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWhen an error is noted in patient care, the most appropriate initial step in fixing the issue is conducting a root cause analysis.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the scenario is comparing two hospitals: a community one staffed only by attending physicians and a teaching hospital with residents. The key point is the time difference in administering tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) for stroke patients. The community hospital does it in 10 minutes, while the teaching hospital takes 2 hours, leading to worse outcomes.\n\nThe question is asking for the next best step to figure out the problem. The options are A to E. Let me think through each option.\n\nFirst, the problem here is the delay in tPA administration. The teaching hospital's longer time is causing adverse outcomes. The question is about elucidating the problem, so we need to find the root cause of the delay. \n\nOption A suggests automatically consulting neurology. Maybe that's part of the process, but if the delay is already 2 hours, maybe the consultation process is part of the problem. But would consulting neurology automatically help? Not sure yet. \n\nOption B is empirically scanning patients. Empirically here might mean doing imaging like a CT scan before giving tPA. But in stroke protocols, you do need a CT to rule out hemorrhage before giving tPA. However, the time difference is about administration, so maybe the scanning is part of the process but perhaps the delay is elsewhere. Not sure if this is the next step to find the problem.\n\nOption C is improving resident education. If residents aren't trained properly, that could cause delays. But the question is about figuring out why the delay is happening. Education might be a solution once the problem is identified, but is it the next step? Maybe not the first step.\n\nOption D is a root cause analysis. That's a structured approach to identify the underlying causes of a problem. Since the question is about elucidating the problem, this seems like a good candidate. Root cause analysis would look into all the steps in the process to find where the delays are happening\u2014like maybe the protocol in the teaching hospital has more steps, or there's a bottleneck with residents needing supervision, or something else in the system.\n\nOption E is a systems-based approach implementation. That sounds like implementing a system change, but again, that's more of a solution. The question is about the next step to further understand the problem, not to implement a fix yet. So maybe E is too much of a solution rather than analysis.\n\nSo the key here is that the problem's root cause needs to be identified first.",

This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 55-year-old man with worsening dyspnea over 48 hours. He recently had a cold and has a history of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. He also had Achilles tendon surgery four weeks ago and has been less mobile. The physical exam shows JVD (jugular venous distension) and a blood pressure that drops during inspiration (that's called pulsus paradoxus, right?). The echocardiogram shows impaired diastolic filling but normal contractility. The ECG is mentioned but we don't have the image.\n\nFirst, let's go through the options. The question is asking for the most likely diagnosis here. Let's consider each option:\n\nA) Cardiac tamponade: This is when fluid builds up in the pericardium, compressing the heart. Symptoms include JVD, muffled heart sounds, pulsus paradoxus (which is a drop in systolic BP during inspiration). The ECG might show electrical alternans. But the echo here shows normal contractility. In tamponade, you might see right heart collapse, but the question mentions impaired diastolic filling. Wait, tamponade can cause impaired filling because the pericardial pressure restricts the heart's expansion. But the contractility is normal here, so maybe that's possible. But let's not jump yet.\n\nB) Constrictive pericarditis: This is chronic inflammation leading to thickened pericardium. It causes elevated JVP (especially Kussmaul's sign, where JVP increases on inspiration), equalization of diastolic pressures in both ventricles, and impaired ventricular filling. The BP might have a pulsus paradoxus too, but I think in constrictive pericarditis, the paradoxus is usually less pronounced than in tamponade. The key here is the impaired diastolic filling on echo. Constrictive pericarditis would affect diastolic function because the rigid pericardium doesn't allow the ventricles to expand properly. The patient's history of recent surgery and immobility might be a distractor, but constrictive pericarditis can develop after pericardial inflammation, maybe from prior issues. But the timeline here is only four weeks since surgery. Maybe not enough time for constrictive pericarditis to develop? Hmm.\n\nC) Myocardial infarction: The ECG",

Furthermore, the patient\u2019s mother was successfully treated for chlamydia during pregnancy, making chlamydial infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer D: Vaginal exam under anesthesia would be appropriate if a foreign body or trauma is suspected because prepubescent children should not undergo exams while awake.

However, the biological father isn't around, and the mom's boyfriend is taking care of the baby.

The options are Reassurance, Report to CPS, Vaginal culture, Vaginal exam under anesthesia, or Warm water irrigation.\n\nFirst, I need to think about why a newborn would have vaginal discharge. In the first week of life, it's common for female infants to have some discharge due to withdrawal from maternal hormones. This can cause a milky discharge or even a little bleeding, which is called pseudomenstruation. That's usually harmless and goes away on its own. But here, the discharge is pink and mucoid. The key points here are the timing and the possible causes.\n\nThe mother had chlamydia in the first trimester, but she was treated and had a test of cure. Chlamydia can cause neonatal conjunctivitis or pneumonia, but usually, if the mother was treated, the baby is given prophylaxis. Wait, but for chlamydia, the standard is that if the mother has chlamydia near delivery, the baby might get it through the birth canal, leading to conjunctivitis or pneumonia. However, since the mother was treated in the first trimester and had a test of cure, maybe the baby wasn't exposed during delivery. But the delivery was at 39 weeks, so maybe the treatment was effective. But the question is about vaginal discharge in the baby.\n\nAnother angle: the discharge could be due to hormonal changes, which is normal. But the presence of the mother's boyfriend taking care of the baby raises a red flag for possible abuse. The question mentions that the biological father isn't involved, and the boyfriend is around.

        "reason": "This patient with a Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 3 and a known mechanism of injury due to motor vehicle accident trauma is normothermic, normotensive, not on sedatives, and without laboratory abnormalities so they are appropriate for examination of brain death. Cortical and brain stem function must be absent in brain death; however, spinal cord reflexes such as triple flexion (flexion of the thigh, leg, and foot upon noxious stimulation of the foot) may remain intact in patients with brain death.\n\nThe clinical brain death exam may be performed in patients with evidence of irreversible central nervous system catastrophe after a known mechanism of trauma or medical injury. The patient must not have other causes for obtundation, and should be euthermic, not on sedative or paralytic agents, not be intoxicated due to drugs or poisoning, and not have other severe electrolyte, acid-base, or endocrine disturbances. In brain death, there must be no cerebral motor response such as moaning or grimacing to pain in all extremities and the face. Brain stem reflexes such as the pupillary light reflex, corneal reflex, oculocephalic reflex, vestibulo-ocular reflex, gag reflex, and apnea test should also be absent in brain death. Spinal cord and deep tendon reflexes may still be present in brain death. Complex movements mediated by the spinal cord such as triple flexion and the Lazarus sign (raising the arms and dropping them crossed on the chest after noxious stimulus) do not preclude a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nGreer et al. review neurologic criteria for the determination of brain death. They discuss how to clinically differentiate spinal motor responses from brain-mediated motor responses. They recommend understanding these distinctions in order to properly examine patients with brain death.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blinking after saline is applied to the cornea indicates a positive corneal reflex. In the corneal reflex, the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal (V1) nerve senses stimulus to the cornea, and bilateral temporal branches of the facial nerve (VII) activate the orbicularis oculi muscles to blink. Brainstem reflexes must be absent in brain death, so the presence of a corneal reflex is not compatible with a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nAnswer B: Conjugate eye movement to the left with rotation of the head to the right describes the oculocephalic reflex. In this reflex, movement of the head stimulates endolymph in the horizontal semicircular canal to rotate, causing the firing of the ipsilateral vestibulocochlear (VIII) nerve. This leads to activation or inhibition of the contralateral abducens (VI) and oculomotor (III) nerves. Brainstem reflexes must be absent in brain death, so the presence of an oculocephalic reflex is not compatible with a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nAnswer D: Grimacing after the noxious stimulus of the arm indicates some residual cortical function. Grimacing is not a spinal cord reflex and requires some cortical processing of sensory information. All cortical function must be absent in brain death, so grimacing to pain would not be compatible with brain death.\n\nAnswer E: Spontaneous respiration 1 minute after disconnection from a ventilator in a patient without diabetes insipidus and with normal blood gas values and systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg indicates a negative apnea test. The apnea test assesses respiratory control system reflexes in the brainstem. Apnea testing is an important component of the brain death exam, and a negative apnea test is incompatible with brain death.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAlthough brain death criteria universally include the absence of cortical and brainstem function, spinal cord and deep tendon reflexes may be preserved in patients with brain death.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The question is about identifying which physical exam finding is compatible with brain death. The patient is a 47-year-old man who was in a car accident, has a history of hypertension but isn't on meds. His GCS was 6 initially and dropped to 3 a week later. They've already stopped sedatives and paralytics, and labs are normal.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the criteria for brain death. Brain death is the complete and irreversible loss of brain function, including the brainstem. The key signs include unresponsiveness, absence of brainstem reflexes, and apnea. Let me go through each option.\n\nOption A: Blinking after saline on the cornea. Blinking is a brainstem reflex. If the patient is brain dead, this reflex should be absent because the brainstem isn't functioning. So if they blink, that's a sign of brainstem activity, meaning not brain dead. So A would not be compatible with brain death.\n\nOption B: Conjugate eye movement to the left with head turned right. That sounds like the oculocephalic reflex, also known as the doll's eye maneuver. In brainstem death, these reflexes should be absent. If the eyes move conjugately when the head is turned, that's a normal reflex, so presence of this would mean the brainstem is still working. So B is not compatible with brain death.\n\nOption C: Flexion of thigh, leg, foot upon noxious stimulation. That's a spinal reflex, like a deep tendon reflex or a withdrawal reflex. Even in brain death, spinal reflexes can still occur because the spinal cord can respond to stimuli without the brain. So this finding is possible in brain death. Wait, but the question is asking which finding is compatible with brain death. So if they have spinal reflexes, that's okay because brain death doesn't eliminate spinal reflexes. So C might be a possible answer, but I need to check others.\n\nOption D: Grimacing after noxious stimulus. Grimacing is a facial expression indicating pain, which requires some higher brain function. Even if it's a reflex, grimacing is more of a cortical response. Wait, but maybe it's a spinal reflex? Hmm. Wait, noxious stimuli can cause spinal reflexes like withdrawal, but grimacing involves facial muscles, which might require brainstem or higher centers. If the brainstem is non-functional, then grimacing wouldn't happen. So",

Prior to more invasive measures, topical therapy with oxymetazoline should be tried as it is very successful in reducing or resolving epistaxis.\n\nEpistaxis can be a benign or life-threatening presentation. For anterior epistaxis, the management is centered on compression of the anterior nares as most cases are caused by bleeding from Kiesselbach plexus. If this fails, the next step in management is having the patient blow their nose to remove any clots, followed by vigorous application of topical oxymetazoline which vasoconstricts the vessels in the nares and is highly effective in treating epistaxis. If this fails, other topical agents include topical tranexamic acid, and thrombogenic foams. If pressure and topical therapy fail to resolve epistaxis, then anterior nasal packing (such as nasal tampons) may be used.\n\nKucik and Clenney review treatments for epistaxis. They note that the first-line treatment of anterior epistaxis is compression of the anterior nares. If this fails, they recommend other measures such as topical vasoconstrictors, cautery, and packing.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cauterization with silver nitrate is appropriate for anterior epistaxis, but generally should be reserved for patients who have failed initial medical therapy with topical agents. It may also be appropriate first-line therapy in patients with recurrent epistaxis from a clear, single bleeding vessel (which is not present in this patient).\n\nAnswer B: Fresh frozen plasma and intravenous phytonadione is the appropriate reversal agent for warfarin. While this may stop the patient's epistaxis, he is hemodynamically stable and the bleeding is not life-threatening; thus, the risk of thrombus from atrial fibrillation is likely greater than the risk of bleeding in this case of epistaxis. Less invasive medical therapy should be started/tried first.\n\nAnswer C: Intravenous tranexamic acid would be appropriate in an acutely hemorrhaging patient to reduce bleeding in the setting of hemorrhagic shock. Topical (not intravenous) tranexamic acid may be an appropriate first-line agent for anterior epistaxis.\n\nAnswer D: Placement of posterior nasal packing would be indicated if there was persistent bleeding in the setting of posterior epistaxis (often from bleeding from the sphenopalatine artery), which presents with more profuse bleeding that may threaten the airway. This patient's bleeding is clearly anterior as it can easily be visualized in the anterior nares; thus, this intervention is not needed.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTopical oxymetazoline and other topical agents such as tranexamic acid are appropriate first-line agents in the management of epistaxis if pressure alone fails to resolve symptoms.",

He's presenting with epistaxis that he can't control with pressure, ice, and head elevation. The question is about the initial management step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the management steps for epistaxis. Epistaxis can be anterior or posterior. Since the physical exam shows active bleeding in the anterior nares and no clear single vessel, it's probably anterior. But he's not responding to initial measures like pressure. \n\nThe options are: cauterization, FFP and phytonadione (which are for coagulopathy), tranexamic acid (a antifibrinolytic), posterior packing, or topical oxymetazoline.\n\nThe patient is on warfarin, which affects coagulation. So his INR might be elevated. But the question is about the initial step. The first line for anterior epistaxis is usually topical vasoconstrictors like oxymetazoline, followed by cauterization if that fails. But since he's already tried pressure and others, maybe moving to cauterization. However, if the bleeding isn't from a single vessel, maybe that's harder. Alternatively, since he's on warfarin, maybe correcting the coagulopathy first?\n\nWait, the question says he's unable to control it with pressure, head elevation, and ice.

But if that's not working, then maybe cauterization. But the question is the most appropriate initial step now in the ED. \n\nAlternatively, since he's on warfarin, maybe they need to reverse the anticoagulation first. FFP and phytonadione (vit K) would help with warfarin reversal. But that's more of a step if the bleeding is due to coagulopathy. However, the initial management for active bleeding is usually local measures first. \n\nThe options: (B) is about reversing warfarin.

Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.",

The physical exam has bilateral crackles and wheezing.\n\nThe question is about the next step in management. The options are Albuterol and prednisone, Digoxin, Diltiazem, Intubation, or Metoprolol.\n\nFirst, considering his history of heart failure and the current presentation, the crackles suggest pulmonary edema. The wheezing might be from COPD exacerbation or bronchospasm. The high heart rate (140) could be a compensatory response to the stress of respiratory distress or underlying tachycardia from various causes.\n\nThe ECG and chest X-ray aren't visible, but given the context, the chest X-ray (Figure B) might show pulmonary edema. The ECG (Figure A) could show atrial fibrillation, which is common in heart failure and can lead to rapid heart rates. If the ECG shows atrial fib with a fast ventricular response, then controlling the rate is crucial. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker used for rate control in AF, especially in those with heart failure. However, in acute decompensated heart failure, sometimes beta-blockers are avoided acutely, but metoprolol is a beta-blocker. Wait, but the patient is in acute distress. Alternatively, if the rhythm is sinus tachycardia, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the high heart rate could be due to anxiety or metabolic causes. But given his history, atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia in heart failure. If the ECG shows AF, then rate control is needed. Diltiazem is a possible option, but digoxin is another.

It has multiple etiologies, including disc herniation, epidural abscess, tumor, or lumbar spine spondylosis. Cauda equina syndrome presents with severe low back pain radiating into the legs, flaccid paralysis or lower extremity weakness which can be symmetric or asymmetric (often asymmetric), bladder and/or rectal sphincter paralysis, impotence/erectile dysfunction, sensory loss in affected dermatomes, and saddle anesthesia (sensory loss in the perineum). Urinary retention occurs due to bladder paralysis. Diagnosis is aided by emergency magnetic resonance imaging. Cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency; the goal of surgical treatment is to decompress the cauda equina to prevent permanent neurological injury, such as with a lumbar laminectomy. This can be differentiated from conus medullaris syndrome, which has perianal numbness without numbness through other dermatomes (down the leg in the S1 or S2 patterns), less severe pain (cauda equina presents with more severe pain), and hyperreflexia in the knees (cauda equina presents with lower motor neuron signs in the legs which lead to decreased reflexes - though conus medullaris may present with absent ankle reflexes, the knees are typically hyperreflexic).\n\nGardner et al. review the symptoms, diagnosis, and medico-legal landscape of cauda equina syndrome. They discuss how the most frequent etiology is a large central lumbar disc herniation. They recommend being vigilant for urinary retention in patients who may have compression as many patients have urinary retention on presentation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, also known as Guillain-Barre syndrome, occurs after respiratory or gastrointestinal infections and presents with ascending paralysis and diminished reflexes. While bladder dysfunction can occur, back pain is not typical. Guillain-Barre syndrome can be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\nAnswer C: L5/S1 disc herniation affects the traversing S1 nerve root. S1 radiculopathy presents with posterolateral leg and dorsolateral foot sensory loss and absence of the ankle reflex. Typically, bowel/bladder symptoms are not present. Treatment includes decompression of the affected nerve root.\n\nAnswer D: Overflow incontinence is caused by either bladder outlet obstruction or poor bladder tone. While this could explain this patient\u2019s urinary retention, it does not account for his back pain or sensorimotor deficits. Isolated overflow incontinence can be treated with catheterization.\n\nAnswer E: Spinal stenosis presents with lower extremity claudication, characterized by pain with standing or ambulation. The pain of neurogenic claudication is characteristically relieved by spinal flexion (\u201cshopping cart sign\u201d). Sensory loss and motor weakness can be present; however, bladder dysfunction is atypical.

Patients will experience difficulty staying awake in the early evening (5 to 8 pm); however, they will typically sleep a normal quantity of hours. These patients generally feel well rested in the morning and are able to function normally during the day. This condition can impair social activities that occur in the evening, which can cause distress to the patient. The diagnosis of advanced sleep phase disorder can be made when these symptoms are present in addition to an absence of another organic cause (such as obstructive sleep apnea). Treatment is with bright light visual stimulation therapy and reconditioning of circadian rhythms.\n\nYaremchuk reviews the diagnosis and treatment of patients with sleep phase disorder. She discusses how sleep disorders such as advanced sleep phase disorder should be distinguished from normal aging. She recommends intervening when sleep quality is compromised as it reduces quality of life in the elderly.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chronic insomnia will present with trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, often alternating with other sleep pathologies. This patient does not claim to have any trouble falling or staying asleep. He also feels well rested in the morning so his sleep quality is adequate. Treatment of insomnia may include melatonin and sleep hygiene.\n\nAnswer C: Delayed sleep phase disorder typically presents in younger patients with difficulty falling asleep early. These patients will often fall asleep very late and struggle to wake up early for obligations such as school or work. Treatment is with melatonin and sleep hygiene interventions.\n\nAnswer D: Normal aging presents with patients claiming that their sleep is less restful in the absence of an organic cause (such as obstructive sleep apnea). As patients age, it is natural for all phases of their sleep to shorten. However, it is not normal for this patient to have such difficulty staying awake in the early evening, so advanced sleep phase disorder is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer E: Obstructive sleep apnea presents with fatigue, morning headaches, and non-restful sleep. Patients will typically snore loudly and typically are overweight. This patient does not have any of these risk factors or symptoms in his history. Treatment is with positive airway pressure machines and weight loss.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAdvanced sleep phase disorder presents with difficulty staying awake in the early evening that impairs social functioning.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 69-year-old man who's having trouble staying awake past 6 pm since he retired. He wants to be active in the evening with his wife but can't stay awake. He mentions that he feels rested and his wife says he sleeps peacefully. His medical history includes IBS managed with fiber, and his vitals are normal. The options are sleep disorders.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the different sleep disorders listed. Let's go through each option. \n\nAdvanced sleep phase disorder (ASP) is when someone's circadian rhythm shifts earlier, so they get tired early in the evening and wake up very early. That seems to fit here because he can't stay up past 6 pm, which is an early bedtime. He might be going to sleep early and then waking up early, feeling rested. \n\nDelayed sleep phase is the opposite, where people stay up late and sleep in. So (C) is probably not it. \n\nChronic insomnia (B) would involve difficulty falling or staying asleep, but the patient here says he feels rested and his wife says he sleeps well. So insomnia doesn't fit. \n\nNormal aging (D) might have some effect on sleep patterns, but it's more about fragmented sleep or early awakenings, not necessarily an inability to stay awake in the evening. \n\nObstructive sleep apnea (E) usually causes daytime sleepiness because of poor sleep quality, but the patient here feels rested, so maybe not apnea. \n\nSo the key points are early evening sleepiness and early sleep onset, which points to advanced sleep phase disorder. The answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nA",

An appropriate maternal HIV treatment regimen is abacavir, lamivudine, and raltegravir; prophylaxis in the infant consists of zidovudine alone if maternal HIV viral load is suppressed to < 50 copies/mL.\n\nAll pregnant women should be screened for HIV as early as possible during pregnancy. Maternal treatment for HIV should be initiated as early as possible (before pregnancy if possible) with highly-active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) consisting of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as abacavir/lamivudine, plus an integrase inhibitor (e.g., raltegravir) or a protease inhibitor (e.g., ritonavir/atazanavir). Regimens for prophylaxis in infants of HIV-positive mothers depends on the HIV viral load at the time of delivery. If the viral load is < 50 copies/mL, infant prophylaxis with zidovudine alone for 4 weeks is sufficient. If the viral load is \u2265 50 copies/mL or the mother did not receive HAART during pregnancy, infant prophylaxis should consist of the 3-drug regimen of: zidovudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or raltegravir for 6 weeks.\n\nHarris et al. reviewed the treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy. They found that although anti-retroviral therapy during pregnancy significantly reduces mother-to-child transmission of HIV, it is still associated with certain perinatal complications such as low birthweight and preterm delivery. Despite these risks, they recommend anti-retroviral therapy during pregnancy and during breastfeeding to prevent transmission.\n\nFigure A shows the answer choices.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Maternal treatment with abacavir/lamivudine/raltegravir and no neonatal treatment is inappropriate because all infants of HIV-positive mothers should receive zidovudine (if maternal viral load < 50 copies/mL at delivery). Lamivudine and raltegravir would be added if maternal viral load is \u2265 50 copies/mL at delivery.\n\nAnswer B: Maternal treatment with abacavir/lamivudine/raltegravir and neonatal prophylaxis with zidovudine/lamivudine/raltegravir would be appropriate if the maternal viral load were \u2265 50 copies/mL at delivery. The HIV viral load in this patient was assumed to be undetectable at delivery.\n\nAnswer D: Maternal treatment with raltegravir/ritonavir/atazanavir and neonatal prophylaxis with zidovudine/lamivudine/raltegravir is inappropriate because raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor and ritonavir/atazanavir are protease inhibitors. HAART must include 2 NRTIs. Atazanavir is often co-administered with ritonavir to increase the former\u2019s bioavailability. Additionally, zidovudine/lamivudine/raltegravir is the neonatal regimen for infants whose mothers have a viral load \u2265 50 copies/mL at delivery.\n\nAnswer E: Maternal treatment with raltegravir/ritonavir/atazanavir and neonatal prophylaxis with zidovudine only is inappropriate because HAART for the mother must include 2 NRTIs.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMaternal HIV infection should consist of highly-active anti-retroviral therapy consisting of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus either an integrase inhibitor or protease inhibito, while neonatal prophylaxis consists of zidovudine only for infants of mothers with viral load < 50 copies/mL at delivery.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 25-year-old pregnant woman at 12 weeks gestation. She's in her first pregnancy (G1P0) and hasn't had prenatal care yet. The key point here is that she has an HIV antibody test that came back positive. The question is asking about the maternal regimen she's likely on and the neonatal prophylaxis needed, assuming her viral load is undetectable by delivery.\n\nFirst, I remember that for HIV-positive pregnant women, the standard of care is antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the virus and prevent transmission to the baby. The current guidelines recommend starting ART as soon as possible, regardless of CD4 count or viral load. Since she's 12 weeks along and just starting care, they would initiate treatment immediately.\n\nThe regimen typically includes a combination of drugs. The common first-line regimens are usually a boosted protease inhibitor plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with NRTIs. For example, dolutegravir (an INSTI) plus tenofovir/emtricitabine is a common combination now because it's effective and has fewer side effects.\n\nNow, regarding neonatal prophylaxis. If the mother's viral load is undetectable at delivery, the baby still needs prophylaxis. The standard is to give neonatal zidovudine (AZT) starting within 6-12 hours after birth, continuing for 6 weeks. This reduces the risk of transmission further. Also, if the mother is on certain drugs like efavirenz, there might be considerations, but since dolutegravir is preferred now, that's probably the regimen here.\n\nLooking at the options, I need to see which one matches. The options aren't listed here, but based on standard answers, the correct maternal regimen would be a combination like dolutegravir + tenofovir/emtricitabine, and neonatal prophylaxis with AZT. So the answer should correspond to that combination. Since the options are labeled A to E, but without seeing them, I have to assume that the correct choice is the one that pairs the standard ART regimen with neonatal AZT. The question mentions Figure A, but since I can't see the figure, I have to go with standard knowledge. The most likely answer is option C",

Combined with her CT finding of a space-occupying butterfly-shaped lesion, the most likely diagnosis is glioblastoma multiforme.\n\nGlioblastoma multiforme is the most common malignant primary nervous system cancer, most commonly occurring in adults above the age of 65. The tumor arises from the cerebral hemispheres and classically crosses the corpus callosum, producing a butterfly appearance on CT/MRI. Pseudopalasading necrosis is seen on biopsy, and tissue biopsy is usually glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive. It has an unfavorable prognosis with a life expectancy of 6 months to 1 year. Management of glioblastoma includes surgical resection and palliative radiotherapy/chemotherapy.\n\nStupp et al. studied the role of electrical field therapy (TTFields) in conjunction with temozolomide in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. The authors found that combination therapy improved median progression-free survival (6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p < 0.001). The authors recommend that clinicians consider the use of TTFields to treat selected patients with glioblastoma multiforme.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a non-contrast axial head CT showing the classic butterfly lesion characteristic of glioblastoma multiforme (red arrow).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cerebral toxoplasmosis presents on imaging with multiple ring-enhancing lesions and is most common in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), especially with CD4 T-cell counts of less than 100 cells/mm^3. This patient has no signs of infection or ring-enhancing lesions.\n\nAnswer C: Hemorrhagic stroke presents acutely with hemiparesis, altered mental status, slurred speech, or sensorimotor symptoms. CT imaging would reveal a hemorrhage.\n\nAnswer D: Metastatic brain tumor often presents with imaging findings of multiple well-circumscribed lesions with surrounding edema. These lesions are generally found at the highly vascularized gray-white junction. In a patient with no smoking history, a single brain lesion, and no other extra-cranial symptoms, this is a less likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer E: Neurosarcoidosis can be caused by infiltrative sarcoidosis and often presents with bitemporal hemianopsia due to infiltration of the pituitary gland. Patients with sarcoidosis typically also present with pulmonary symptoms (e.g., wheezing and coughing) which are absent in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nGlioblastoma multiforme should be suspected in patients presenting with symptoms of increasing intracranial pressure and classic CT/MRI findings of a butterfly shaped lesion with central necrosis.",

She presented with a tonic-clonic seizure, which is a big red flag. The symptoms she's had over the past five months include worsening headaches and intermittent nausea. The headaches are constant and dull, getting worse with sneezing or laughing. Those are classic signs of increased intracranial pressure because Valsalva maneuvers like sneezing or laughing can increase pressure in the head, making the headache worse.\n\nShe's also had recent nausea and vomiting, which again points towards increased ICP. The physical exam shows papilledema, which is swelling of the optic disc due to high pressure in the skull. Papilledema is a key sign of raised intracranial pressure. The CT scan findings are mentioned but the image isn't available, so I have to rely on the clinical presentation.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) Cerebral toxoplasmosis: This is more common in immunocompromised patients, like those with HIV/AIDS. Since her history doesn't mention any immunosuppression, this might be less likely unless there's an underlying condition not mentioned. But given her age and the other symptoms, maybe not the top choice.\n\nB) Glioblastoma multiforme: This is a malignant brain tumor. It can present with headaches, seizures, and increased ICP. The time course here is five months, which is a bit longer than typical for glioblastoma, which often progresses more rapidly, but it's still possible. The papilledema would fit with increased pressure from a mass.\n\nC) Hemorrhagic stroke: This usually presents more acutely, with sudden onset of symptoms. The patient here has a gradual progression over months, so maybe less likely unless there's a chronic bleed, but hemorrhagic strokes are typically more abrupt.\n\nD) Metastatic brain tumor: This is a consideration, especially in someone with a history of cancer. However, her history only mentions diabetes and hypertension. If she has an undiagnosed cancer, metastasis could be possible. But since the question doesn't mention any other cancers, maybe glioblastoma is more likely as a primary brain tumor.\n\nE) Neurosarcoidosis: This is inflammation of the nervous system due to sarcoidosis.

This leads to an increase in the mass of the left ventricle. There are many possible criteria on ECG for left ventricular hypertrophy including left axis deviation, large R waves, a large S wave in aVR, or ST segment depression and T wave inversion in the left heart leads (referred to as left ventricular strain). A more simple method of recalling left ventricular hypertrophy is very large voltages in the ECG leads that serve the left ventricle. Left ventricular hypertrophy should be considered in presentations such as syncope. Note that while ECG findings suggest left ventricular hypertrophy, the diagnosis must be supported with echocardiography. Management involves treating the underlying cause (most commonly, this is hypertension).\n\nArtham et al. discuss left ventricular hypertrophy. They note that it is a risk factor for future cardiac events and increased mortality. They recommend early diagnosis and management to improve outcomes.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG with very large voltages (red arrows) and ST segment depressions/T wave inversions (blue arrows, a more classic left ventricular strain pattern), concerning for left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction would present with nonspecific ST segment and T wave changes with an elevated troponin. While this patient does demonstrate ST depressions in the lateral leads, the troponin level is normal.\n\nAnswer C: ST elevation myocardial infarction would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG in the setting of chest pain, diaphoresis, and an elevated troponin level. Note that this patient\u2019s lack of symptoms (pain) and normal troponin in the setting of the ST elevation in leads V1-V3 make this unlikely to be ST elevation myocardial infarction and more likely to be left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nAnswer D: Torsades des pointes occurs in patients with a prolonged QT interval that evolves into twisting of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric baseline. It may cause syncope or cardiac arrest. Note there is no QT prolongation on this patient\u2019s ECG that would predispose him to this condition.\n\nAnswer E: Wolff Parkinson White syndrome presents with a delta wave on ECG (a slurred upstroke into the QRS complex) and may undulate with supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia. There is no delta wave in this patient\u2019s ECG supporting this diagnosis.

The ECG is mentioned but we can't see it, so maybe the answer hinges on other clues.\n\nLooking at the labs: Hemoglobin and hematocrit are within normal ranges, so no anemia. BUN and creatinine are normal, so kidney function okay. Glucose is 139, which is a bit high but not super elevated. Troponin is normal, which suggests no recent heart attack.

The question mentions Figure A, but since we can't see it, maybe the answer is based on other info. The patient has a history of hypertension, so left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is possible. LVH can cause fainting if it leads to arrhythmias or reduced cardiac output, especially with exertion like carrying boxes. \n\nTorsades des pointes (D) is a specific arrhythmia causing polymorphic VT, but the ECG would show that. Since the patient's current rhythm is stable (pulse 86, no mention of irregular), maybe not. Wolff-Parkinson-White (E) is a pre-excitation syndrome, but again, the ECG would show delta waves. Without seeing the ECG, but given the options, and the fact that troponin is normal, maybe LVH is the best fit. \n\nThe fainting during exertion could be due to an arrhythmia triggered by LVH, or maybe a drop in blood pressure due to the heart's inability to handle the exertion.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after an axial load on his lower extremity (landing off a ski jump) with severe pain, a fracture on radiography, and severe pain with passive range of motion. This suggests compartment syndrome in the setting of a tibial plateau fracture.\n\nTibial plateau fractures occur as a result of an axial load, where the femur forcefully impacts the tibia, leading to intense pain in the proximal tibia region. One potential complication of this type of fracture is compartment syndrome, which presents with exquisite pain out of proportion to exam with passive motion of the lower extremity. While radiography can aid in diagnosing tibial plateau fractures, a negative radiograph should prompt further investigation with a CT scan in patients with a high suspicion of this type of fracture. Treatment involves performing a fasciotomy if compartment syndrome is present. Surgical repair is warranted if there is evidence of neurovascular compromise or a significantly displaced fracture. Otherwise, immobilizing the knee and providing outpatient orthopedic follow-up care is deemed appropriate for certain less severe fractures.\n\nSchneiderman et al. studied compartment syndrome in high-energy tibial plateau fractures. The authors found that younger patients aged 12-29 years old are more likely to develop compartment syndrome, likely due to increased muscle mass and thicker fascial tissue. The risk of deep surgical site infection remains high at 20-25% of cases. The authors recommend that clinicians should be aware of factors associated with increased risk for compartment syndrome, including young age, male gender, and a high-energy mechanism of injury.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a radiograph demonstrating a tibial plateau fracture with the red arrows demonstrating a fracture of the tibial plateau.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior cruciate ligament tear would present with a sudden popping sensation of the knee with swelling, knee instability, and laxity to anterior traction when force is applied to the tibia causing anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur. Management involves assessment with MRI and surgical repair in complete tears or immobilization in partial tears.\n\nAnswer B: Apophysitis of the tibial tubercle (Osgood-Schlatter disease) is common in pediatric patients and presents after exertion (such as basketball or jumping) with pain and tenderness over the tibial tubercle. It is caused by repeated microtrauma or microavulsion, separation of the proximal patellar tendon from the tibial tubercle, and subsequent callous deposition at the tibial tubercle. Management involves rest, ice, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nAnswer C: Patellar fracture would present with tenderness over the patella with a fracture line on the patella. Treatment of non-displaced fractures includes rest and immobilization in a straight-leg knee immobilizer.\n\nAnswer D: Posterior dislocation of the knee presents with sudden trauma to the knee with pain, swelling, and a loss of pulses in the extremity when the popliteal artery is compromised. Radiography is diagnostic and will show a knee dislocation. Treatment involves immediate reduction to avoid permanent injury to the popliteal artery.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTibial plateau fractures present after trauma with severe lower extremity pain and are highly associated with compartment syndrome.",

He's in severe pain, 10/10, and there's swelling over the knee and leg. On exam, moving the foot passively causes him to cry out. The X-ray is mentioned but we can't see it, so we have to rely on the clinical info.\n\nFirst, think about common injuries from a high-impact injury like a ski accident. The key points here are the mechanism (landing from a jump), the location (knee and leg), and the pain with passive ankle movement. \n\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common in sports with sudden stops or twisting. But ACL injuries might not always have severe swelling immediately, and pain with ankle movement? Hmm, maybe not directly related. ACL tears usually involve knee instability, but the question mentions pain with passive ankle motion, which might be a stretch.\n\nApophysitis of the tibial tubercle (like Osgood-Schlatter disease) is more common in adolescents, especially during growth spurts. Since he's 27, that's less likely. So probably not B.\n\nPatellar fracture could cause knee pain and swelling. But would it cause pain with moving the ankle? The patella is part of the knee, so maybe indirect pain, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. Also, the X-ray might show a fracture line if that's the case.\n\nPosterior dislocation of the knee is rare. It's a serious injury where the tibia moves posteriorly relative to the femur. This would be very painful and likely have significant deformity. The patient might have neurovascular compromise. But the question mentions swelling over the knee and leg, and pain with ankle movement. A posterior dislocation would probably present with more obvious deformity and maybe foot complications, but I'm not certain.\n\nTibial plateau fracture: The tibial plateau is the upper end of the tibia, forming the knee joint. A fracture here could occur from a high-impact injury like a fall from skiing. Swelling around the knee, pain with movement, especially if the fracture affects the joint surface. The pain with passive ankle motion might be due to the injury's location and possible involvement of structures that affect the lower leg. Since the X-ray is mentioned, a tibial plateau fracture would show up on radiographs as a break in",

This condition increases the risk of midgut volvulus where the intestines create a closed loop. Abdominal radiographs are rarely diagnostic but are useful in excluding bowel perforation. An upper gastrointestinal series is the diagnostic test of choice and demonstrates an abnormally placed duodenum with a ligament of Treitz on the right side of the abdomen and a \u201ccorkscrew\u201d appearance of the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the bowel or exploratory laparotomy if perforation has occurred.\n\nAdams and Stanton review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal bowel obstruction.

Treatment is with surgical repair of the obstructed segment.\n\nAnswer B: Hirschsprung disease may also cause bilious vomiting, but an abdominal radiograph would demonstrate proximal colonic distension with little air in the rectosigmoid colon. Hirschsprung disease is also well visualized on contrast enema, on which a transition point can be seen between the proximal dilated colon and the narrow sigmoid. Treatment is with excision of the defective segment.\n\nAnswer D: Jejunal atresia can also lead to bilious vomiting, although a \u201ctriple bubble\u201d sign would be seen on an abdominal radiograph with air additionally filling the proximal jejunum. Treatment is with excision of the atretic segment and anastomosis of the bowel lumen.\n\nAnswer E: Meconium ileus may present with bilious emesis, but multiple dilated loops of bowel would be seen on an abdominal radiograph. Meconium ileus is better characterized by contrast enema, on which a microcolon can be visualized.

Since bile is green, and it's in the vomitus, that suggests the obstruction is beyond the duodenum because bile enters the small intestine there. The baby is also having abdominal distension and hypoactive bowel sounds. The options given are duodenal atresia, Hirschsprung's, malrotation, jejunal atresia, and meconium ileus.\n\nFirst, duodenal atresia (A) would typically present with bilious vomiting early, maybe even in the first day or two. The classic \"double bubble\" sign on X-ray is seen here. But the baby is 4 days old, so maybe possible. However, the abdominal radiograph and upper GI series (which the user can't see, but we have to go by the description) might show that.\n\nHirschsprung's (B) is a problem with the colon, leading to megacolon. Newborns might have delayed meconium passage, but the vomitus here is green, so obstruction in the small bowel. Hirschsprung's usually presents with constipation and distension, but maybe with obstruction higher up if there's a backup. Not sure.\n\nIntestinal malrotation (C) can lead to midgut volvulus, which is a surgical emergency. The classic presentation is bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and maybe a \"whirlpool sign\" on imaging. Since the baby is 4 days old, that's a common time for volvulus to occur. The upper GI series would show the duodenum ending abruptly if there's malrotation with volvulus.\n\nJejunal atresia (D) would also cause bilious vomiting. The X-ray might show \"microgastrol poly intestinal loops\" but I'm not sure. The location is further down than duodenal atresia.\n\nMeconium ileus (E) is usually seen in newborns with cystic fibrosis. The vomitus would be green (since it's meconium mixed with bile), but the baby might have a history of meconium passage issues. The X-ray would show a \"soap bubble\" appearance.

Patients are often asymptomatic when the diagnosis is made or may present with vague constitutional symptoms including fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. It is important to note that symptoms may be subtle or absent. Other findings include non-tender lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The diagnosis is supported when the white blood cell count is >50,000/mm^3 and can be supported with a peripheral smear which will show smudge cells. The cells in CLL may be CD5, CD20, and CD23 positive. The most common cause of death in this population is infection given the lack of competent B-cells.\n\nHallek reviews CLL. They discuss updated guidelines on the diagnosis and management of CLL. They recommend the use of targeted agents in initial therapy and acknowledge the need for further clinical trials to guide therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common malignancy seen in children and presents with pancytopenia, anemia, fatigue, leukopenia (leading to recurrent infections), and thrombocytopenia (leading to bleeding). Other findings may include fever, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly.

Patients will present with fatigue, malaise, weight loss, anorexia, fever, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Auer rods are frequently present on a blood smear.\n\nAnswer D: Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells and presents with a leukocyte count often >50,000/mm3. The increased myeloid lines include red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets. Many patients present in the chronic phase with minimal symptoms; however, the blast phase can lead to a hematologic emergency termed a blast crisis which may cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. This condition is more symptomatic and less common than CLL.\n\nAnswer E: Hairy cell leukemia occurs when there is a neoplastic proliferation of mature B cells with abundant cytoplasm with \u201chairy\u201d cytoplasmic processes.

But ALL is more common in children, though it can occur in adults. The patient here is elderly, so maybe less likely, but not impossible.

AML can present with different findings, but the age here is older. However, AML can occur at any age. The problem is distinguishing between acute and chronic here.\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) usually has a slow progression. The WBC in CLL is elevated, but typically the lymphocyte count is high because it's a lymphocytic leukemia. CLL is common in older adults. However, the platelets and hemoglobin are often lower as the disease progresses. But CLL's WBC might not be as high as 67k? Or can it be? I think CLL can have very high lymphocyte counts, but maybe not as extremely as in CML?\n\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is known for a very high WBC, often in the tens of thousands. The classic triad is splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and a specific genetic marker (Philadelphia chromosome). The age here is 72, which is typical for CML. The high WBC (67k) is a big red flag for CML. Also, in CML, the white count is usually myeloid cells, so the differential would show a lot of myelocytes, metamyelocytes.

        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 37-year-old machinist with a month-long history of a mass in his eye. His past medical history includes blepharitis and squamous cell carcinoma treated with Mohs surgery. The physical exam shows a firm, rubbery nodule in the left eyelid without pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible diagnoses given the options. The options are Chalazion, Foreign body, Hordeolum, Ingrown eyelash follicle, and Meibomian cell carcinoma.\n\nStarting with the basics: a chalazion is a painless bump that forms due to a blocked oil gland in the eyelid. It's usually firm and not tender. Hordeolum, or stye, is an infection of the oil glands, so it's typically red, swollen, and painful. Since the nodule here isn't painful, that might lean away from a hordeolum. \n\nForeign body would likely cause more irritation, redness, or pain, and might have a recent history of exposure, which isn't mentioned here. Ingrown eyelash follicle (trichiasis) might cause discomfort or irritation but probably not a firm nodule. \n\nNow, considering the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma can sometimes recur, especially if they've had prior skin cancers. The eyelid is a common site for skin cancers. Meibomian gland carcinoma, which is a type of sebaceous gland carcinoma, could also present as a firm nodule. Since the nodule has been present for a month and is firm/rubbery, and given the history of skin cancer, this might be a concern. \n\nChalazion is benign, but given the patient's history of cancer, the possibility of a malignancy can't be ignored. The fact that it's painless might be a clue because cancers are often painless initially. The physical exam doesn't mention redness or inflammation, which is more typical of an infection like a hordeolum. \n\nSo between chalazion and meibomian cell carcinoma. Chalazion is more common and usually resolves over time, but since this has been there for a month and is firm, maybe it's not going away, which could be a red flag. The patient's history of skin cancer might increase the risk here. \n\nWait, the options include Meibomian cell carcinoma (E). Meibomian gland carcinoma is",

The most appropriate initial treatment is symptomatic relief with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nReduced estrogen levels after menopause lead to vulvovaginal atrophy by causing reduced blood flow and collagen content in vulvovaginal tissues. Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues. Finally, hormone replacement therapy is indicated if symptoms are refractory to all other modalities.\n\nBhupathiraju et al. studied the association between vaginal estrogen and chronic disease risk. The authors found no association between low-dose vaginal estrogen and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and hip fractures over an 18-year period. The authors recommended that low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used indefinitely without concomitant progestin therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole is the treatment for trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis. While patients with trichomoniasis can present with cervical petechiae and punctate hemorrhages, they typically also have frothy green discharge (absent in this patient). While patients with bacterial vaginosis can also have vaginal discharge, the discharge is typically malodorous and symptoms of pruritis are generally absent.\n\nAnswer B: Nitrofurantoin is the treatment of choice for urinary tract infections. While this patient has increased urinary frequency and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, her normal urinalysis makes the diagnosis of urinary tract infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer C: Topical clobetasol cream is the treatment for lichen sclerosis. While lichen sclerosis can present with pain with intercourse and vulvar pruritis, patients often have plaques that disrupt the normal vulvar architecture. Lichen sclerosis does not affect the vaginal tissues.\n\nAnswer D: Topical estrogen is the treatment of choice for cases of vulvovaginal atrophy resistant to treatment with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.

The patient is a 59-year-old woman with symptoms of urinary urgency, involuntary urine loss (which isn't stress-related like coughing), vaginal pruritis, and dyspareunia.

The physical exam shows atrophic changes in the vulva and vagina\u2014like pale, thin skin, loss of rugae, petechiae, and friable mucosa. Urinalysis is normal, and ultrasound shows a small uterus.\n\nFirst, the key symptoms here are the vaginal atrophy signs. The vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is common in postmenopausal women due to estrogen deficiency. The symptoms like pruritis, dyspareunia, and urinary urgency (which can be part of genitourinary syndrome of menopause) point towards this. The physical findings of atrophic changes (loss of rugae, petechiae) support that.\n\nThe options given are Metronidazole (A), Nitrofurantoin (B), topical clobetasol (C), topical estrogen (D), and vaginal moisturizers (E). \n\nMetronidazole is for bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis, but her discharge is minimal and clear, and UTI tests (urinalysis normal) don't suggest current infection. She's had UTIs before, but the current issue might not be an infection since the urinalysis is normal. Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic for UTIs, but again, if there's no UTI now, that's not the first step. \n\nTopical clobetasol is a steroid, which might be used for inflammation, but in atrophic vaginitis, estrogen is the main treatment. Steroids could be considered if there's an allergic component or if there's inflammation from irritation, but the primary issue here is estrogen deficiency. \n\nTopical estrogen (D) is the standard treatment for vulvovaginal atrophy. It helps restore the vaginal epithelium, increases moisture, and reduces inflammation and irritation. The atrophic changes and symptoms like dyspareunia and urinary symptoms (which can be part of the genitourinary syndrome) would respond to estrogen. \n\nVaginal moisturizers (E) can help with dryness but are more of a symptomatic treatment.

The patient should have a radiograph of the hand and wrist to evaluate for discrepancies between bone age and chronological age.\n\nDelayed puberty in boys is defined as the absence or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics (increased testicular volume and pubic hair) at 14 years or older. It has a variety of etiologies including chromosomal abnormalities, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiencies, and constitutional delay of puberty. In addition to obtaining a history and physical examination, initial diagnostic studies used to work up delayed puberty includes a radiograph of the hand and wrist to determine bone age, and serum studies (complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, follicular-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], and testosterone). Radiography can compare the patient's bone age to the chronological age (as constitutional delay presents with delayed bone age), and serum endocrine studies can help distinguish between primary causes of hypogonadism (high FSH and LH) and secondary causes of hypogonadism (low to normal FSH and LH). Treatment in cases with a specific cause of delayed puberty is aimed at the underlying cause. For male patients with presumed constitutional delay of puberty, therapy can include hormone replacement with testosterone.\n\nSaengkaew et al. discuss the genetics of pubertal delay. The authors find that pathologic mechanisms that may underlie constitutional delay of puberty are largely related to GnRH neuronal development and biology. The authors recommend further study of GnRH neuronal biology and network functionality to provide the opportunity for improved therapies for patients with disorders of puberty.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Karyotyping is a useful diagnostic study in patients with Klinefelter syndrome, which would demonstrate 47, XXY. Patients would present with a eunuchoid habitus (arm span at least 5 cm longer than height), gynecomastia, and testicular atrophy.\n\nAnswer B: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with gadolinium is a useful diagnostic study in patients with neurological symptoms in addition to hypogonadism. These symptoms would suggest that the patient has a prolactinoma causing impingement of the optic chiasm leading to bitemporal hemianopsia and sometimes a headache. Laboratory studies consistent with a prolactinoma include elevated serum prolactin with low to normal FSH and TSH.\n\nAnswer C: Reassurance with close follow-up would be appropriate in some patients with constitutional delay of puberty, which is the most common cause of delayed puberty. It is believed to be caused by a transient defect in the production of GnRH. Patients typically have a family history of \"late bloomers,\" characterized as family members having a late growth spurt or late puberty.\n\nAnswer E: Testicular ultrasound would be appropriate in patients with asymmetric testicles since gonadal tumors can occur in a number of intersex disorders (e.g., androgen insensitivity syndrome) and present with impaired sexual maturation.\n\nBuller Summary:\nDelayed puberty in boys is defined as a lack of testicular enlargement by age 14 and initial diagnostic evaluation should include radiography of the hand and wrist as well as serum testing (FSH, LH, and testosterone).",

He's otherwise healthy, no symptoms like headaches or vision issues. Physical exam shows lack of facial hair, no pubic hair, small testicles (3 mL). His arm span is less than his height, which might indicate proportions, but not sure.\n\nFirst, I need to think about possible causes for delayed puberty. Since he has no secondary sexual characteristics, this could be constitutional delay, but maybe something else like hypogonadism, Kallmann syndrome, or a chromosomal issue like Klinefelter syndrome. \n\nThe options are karyotyping, brain MRI with gad, hand-wrist X-ray, reassurance, or testicular ultrasound. \n\nHand and wrist X-ray (option C) is used to assess bone age. If his bone age is delayed, that would support constitutional delay. If it's normal or advanced, maybe other issues. Since he's 16, which is towards the later end of normal puberty, but if bone age is young, that's a sign of delay. \n\nKaryotyping (A) is for chromosomal issues like Klinefelter (47,XXY), which can cause delayed puberty and small testes. His testicular volume is 3 mL, which is small (normal for puberty is around 4 mL or more). So maybe considering that. \n\nMRI (B) would be for looking at the pituitary/hypothalamus, like if there's a tumor or Kallmann syndrome (which is anosmia and hypogonadism).

But if it's a simple delay, maybe not needed first. \n\nReassurance (D) is possible if it's a constitutional delay. But given the small testes and no secondary sexual characteristics at 16, maybe more testing is needed. \n\nSo the next step: usually, initial workup for delayed puberty includes bone age (hand/wrist X-ray) to assess if it's constitutional. If bone age is delayed, then it's likely constitutional. If not, then proceed to other tests like karyotype or hormone levels. Since the question",

Poor glycemic control increases the risk of a neural tube defect in the fetus.\n\nInfants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are at increased risk of many congenital malformations as well as postnatal complications. These risks are more likely if there is poor maternal glycemic control, especially in the periconceptional period. Poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c and microalbuminuria on urinalysis indicate long-standing poor glycemic control and indicate a poor prognosis. The most common anomalies in IDM are cardiovascular defects such as septal defects and transposition of the great arteries as well as neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida. Sacral agenesis, or a poorly developed caudal spine and spinal cord, as well as small left colon syndrome due to a meconium plug, are other common malformations seen in IDM. General complications in IDM include prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction or macrosomia, and miscarriage. Risk is minimized by tight glycemic control throughout pregnancy.\n\nDean et al. summarize the evidence surrounding micronutrients and obesity in pregnancy. They found that patients with diabetes had a higher risk of having infants with a neural tube or a congenital heart defect. They recommend using folic acid supplementation in all patients to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aneuoploidy risk is not increased in IDM. This complication is associated with advanced maternal age. This patient is at baseline risk since she is below the \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d cutoff of 35 years. Some of the values used in aneuploidy screening (maternal serum alpha\u00adfetoprotein, estriol, and inhibin A) are generally lower in women with diabetes. Guidelines specific to this patient population should be used for the aneuploidy screen so as to avoid false positive results.\n\nAnswer B: Neonatal hyperglycemia is not seen in IDM. Patients may experience hypoglycemia. This is due to the crossing of glucose from the mother to the fetus via the placenta and subsequent hyperinsulinemia and \u00df-cell hyperplasia from the fetus. After delivery, the high insulin levels cause hypoglycemia because there is no longer an overabundant source of glucose. Hyperglycemia in infants is much less common and can be due to glucose infusion or sepsis.\n\nAnswer D: Oligohydramnios is not specifically associated with maternal hyperglycemia. Instead, patients may experience polyhydramnios. The mechanism for increased amniotic fluid is unclear, though some speculate that fetal hyperglycemia results in polyuria and thus polyhydramnios. Severe oligohydramnios can cause pulmonary hypoplasia and clubfoot as well as cord compression, while polyhydramnios is associated with cord prolapse, placental abruption, and prematurity.\n\nAnswer E: Post-term delivery occurs after 42 weeks gestation. Maternal diabetes typically causes prematurity. Post-term delivery is associated with fetal malnutrition, hypoxemia, and oligohydramnios due to suboptimal functioning of the placenta. The risk of meconium aspiration increases as gestational age increases. Induction of labor is generally performed at 42 weeks to avoid these complications.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMaternal hyperglycemia from diabetes mellitus is associated with congenital heart defects, neural tube defects, and small left colon syndrome.",

The options are aneuploidy, neonatal hyperglycemia, neural tube defect, oligohydramnios, or post-term delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the risks associated with maternal diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy is linked to several fetal issues. High HbA1c is a red flag. Let's go through each option:\n\nA) Aneuploidy: Like Down syndrome. Maternal age over 35 is a risk, but she's 31. However, diabetes isn't directly linked to aneuploidy. Screening for that would be done via nuchal translucency or serum tests, but the question is about complications from her diabetes.\n\nB) Neonatal hyperglycemia: Wait, actually, neonates of diabetic mothers might have issues with hypoglycemia because the fetus is exposed to high glucose, leading to increased insulin production. After birth, the glucose source is gone, so they can have hypoglycemia. So hyperglycemia might not be the main issue here. So B might be incorrect.\n\nC) Neural tube defects: I remember that maternal diabetes is a risk factor for neural tube defects (like spina bifida). But this is more associated with preconception and early pregnancy hyperglycemia. However, the HbA1c here is very high, so maybe that's a factor. But also, folic acid supplementation is important here. But the question is about the current situation. Wait, but the HbA1c reflects the last 2-3 months.

The delivery is uncomplicated and the neonate has Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. After 15 minutes, he attempts to nurse for the 1st time. His mother notices that his face, chest, and extremities turn dusky blue during nursing. She also notes that he seems to be snoring loudly and breathing very quickly. When she removes him from her breast, he begins to cry and his color improves. The neonate\u2019s prenatal course was unremarkable, and his mother has a medical history of asthma with occasional albuterol inhaler use. As the infant is resting, vital signs are taken. His temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 45/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

        "reason": "This neonate presents with central cyanosis upon feeding, resolution with crying, and midface hypoplasia on exam, most consistent with choanal atresia. A nasogastric (NG) tube would not pass through the nasal canal.\n\nChoanal atresia is caused by failed recanalization of the nasal fossae during fetal development. This disease typically presents with noisy breathing, cyanosis when feeding, and improvement with crying and the use of the mouth for breathing. Cyanosis in this condition affects the entire body as opposed to just the hands and feet. Bilateral atresia often presents early in life. Clinical suspicion of choanal atresia should prompt an attempt to pass an NG tube, which will meet resistance at the posterior part of the nasal canal. Treatment is with the surgical creation of the nasal passages.\n\nLesciotto et al. review the diagnosis and pathophysiology of patients with choanal atresia. They discuss how this condition is often comorbid with craniosynostosis. They recommend a better understanding of how these patients develop decreased nasal airway volume.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing midface hypoplasia with a poorly developed nasal bone (red circle). These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of choanal atresia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Areflexia in all extremities may be seen in spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic condition that causes loss of motor neurons. This condition may cause difficulty feeding due to weakness of the oropharyngeal and glossopharyngeal muscles, but it typically does not cause cyanosis. Treatment is with steroid use and nusinersen.\n\nAnswer B: Digital clubbing can result from chronic hypoxemia, as seen in conditions such as cystic fibrosis. It would be unexpected for a neonate to have clubbing as the characteristic finger appearance depends on the long-term deposition of platelet-derived growth factor and would not develop within minutes. This patient also does not have cyanosis at baseline. Treatment of cystic fibrosis is with enzyme repletion and respiratory therapy.\n\nAnswer D: Markedly decreased lung volume can occur in congenital diaphragmatic hernia, in which the abdominal contents herniate into the chest cavity and cause pulmonary hypoplasia. Infants may present with cyanosis due to respiratory failure, but there would be no association with feeding or improvement with crying. Vital signs would also be abnormal. Treatment is with surgical repair of the diaphragm.\n\nAnswer E: A patent foramen ovale occurs when the connection between the left and right atria does not close soon after birth. It does not result in cyanosis and is typically asymptomatic, though it may cause paradoxical embolism and stroke later in life. Treatment of a symptomatic patent foramen ovale is surgical closure of the defect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nChoanal atresia presents with cyanosis and respiratory distress that worsens with feeding and improves with crying associated with failure to pass a nasogastric tube.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The scenario is about a newborn who's having some issues during nursing. The key points here are the dusky blue color (cyanosis) in the face, chest, and extremities when nursing, along with snoring and rapid breathing. When taken off the breast, the baby's color improves and he cries normally. The mother has asthma and uses albuterol occasionally. The baby's vital signs are mostly normal except for the respiratory rate being a bit high (45/min is on the higher side for a newborn, but maybe still within normal limits? Not sure). The oxygen saturation is 97%, which is okay.\n\nThe question is asking which of the options is most likely to be observed. The options are Areflexia, digital clubbing, inability to pass a nasogastric tube, decreased lung volume, or patent foramen ovale.\n\nFirst, let's think about the presentation. The cyanosis during nursing and the improvement when taken off the breast. That makes me think of something that happens when the baby is feeding. The snoring could indicate upper airway obstruction. Maybe something like laryngomalacia? But laryngomalacia usually causes stridor, especially when the baby is agitated or feeds. The snoring might be due to that. However, the question mentions facial features shown in Figure A, which we can't see, but maybe the answer is related to that.\n\nWait, the options given don't include laryngomalacia directly. Let's look at the options again. The options are Areflexia (no reflexes), digital clubbing (which is a sign of chronic hypoxia or cyanotic heart disease), inability to pass a nasogastric tube (maybe due to structural issue like esophageal atresia?), decreased lung volume (like in pulmonary hypoplasia?), or patent foramen ovale (PFO), which is a normal fetal structure that usually closes after birth but might still be present.\n\nThe mother's asthma and albuterol use might be a red herring, but maybe the baby has some respiratory issue. The fact that the cyanosis improves when not nursing suggests that the problem is positional or related to the act of feeding. The snoring could be due to an airway issue. \n\nWait, the patent foramen ovale (option E) is a normal structure in the fetal heart. In fetal circulation, the foramen ovale allows",

        "reason": "This patient's progressively increasing PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex on ECG is consistent with second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz type I, also referred to as Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nSecond degree AV block, Mobitz type I can occur in a variety of settings, such as in the context of digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or increased vagal tone. On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension. The treatment is pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSecond degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I, is characterized by progressively lengthening PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 24-year-old woman with intermittent palpitations. She's otherwise healthy, no meds, no alcohol or drugs. She thinks it's from more caffeine. Her vitals: temp normal, BP 116/76, pulse 55, which is on the lower side but not super low. O2 sat good. The ECG is shown in Figure A, but since I can't see it, I have to rely on the options given.\n\nThe question is about the ECG findings. The options are various AV blocks and sinus bradycardia. The key here is the pulse rate of 55. Sinus bradycardia is a common cause of a slow heart rate. Since she's a fitness instructor, athletes often have lower heart rates, so that's a possibility. \n\nFirst-degree AV block is when the PR interval is prolonged, but all P waves are conducted. The heart rate might be normal or a bit slow, but not as low as 55 unless other factors. Second-degree Mobitz I (Wenckebach) has dropping P waves, so some P's don't conduct. Mobitz II is more severe with blocked conduction but in a fixed ratio. Third-degree is complete heart block with no relation between P and QRS. \n\nSince the question mentions the ECG is shown, but I can't see it, the key clue here is the pulse of 55. Sinus bradycardia (option D) is the most straightforward answer here, especially in a young, healthy person who's physically active. The other AV blocks would have different ECG patterns. For example, first-degree would have a prolonged PR, but the rate might not be that low unless combined with other issues. Since she's asymptomatic except for palpitations (which she attributes to caffeine), and her other vitals are normal, sinus bradycardia is likely. The palpitations might be from occasional PVCs or PACs, but the ECG showing a regular rhythm with a slow rate would point to sinus bradycardia. So the answer is D.\n</think>\n\nD",

Symptoms will include chronic relapsing and remitting episodes of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and nausea.

The key points here are the dizziness with a spinning sensation (vertigo), hearing loss on one side, and nystagmus.

The Epley maneuver is used for BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), which typically causes positional vertigo. But the patient isn't sure if symptoms change with position. The hearing loss might point away from BPPV. \n\nMeniere's disease presents with episodic vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness.

But the patient here has hearing loss, which isn't a classic feature of Wernicke's. However, the question mentions his alcohol use, so maybe thiamine deficiency is a consideration. \n\nAlternatively, could it be a stroke?

Risk factors for developing a keratoacanthoma include immunosuppression, arsenic exposure, old scars or burns, xeroderma pigmentosum, or exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation. Most keratoacanthomas tend to involute within several months after initial onset; however, surgical excision can be performed because of the histologic similarity to squamous cell carcinoma.

These insults lead to worsening cognitive abilities and presents classically as a stepwise decline (sudden/sharp declines in cognitive function that occur at distinct periods of time, not gradually) in cognitive function (thinking, planning, self-control, flexibility in thought). This is often associated with neurologic deficits as byproducts of these strokes. Unlike other forms of dementia, this presentation is step-wise.

Magnetic resonance imaging reveals focal white matter changes consistent with small vascular infarcts.\n\nKhan et al. review the diagnosis and management of vascular dementia while including commentary on recent updates in the literature.

They thus recommend medical management of underlying medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia as treatments for vascular dementia.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows magnetic resonance imaging with white matter small vessel ischemic changes (red arrows) characteristic of vascular dementia within a background of diffuse generalized atrophy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alzheimer disease is a form of dementia that presents with progressive forgetfulness as the first and most jarring clinical symptom, followed by worsening visual/spatial recognition, and then worsening behavioral function. It is most common in patients over the age of 75. It is not associated with focal deficits or weakness on neurological exam.\n\nAnswer B: Mild cognitive impairment is a stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and forms of dementia. Patients and family members may notice problems with memory, thinking, or judgment, but they are not significant enough to cause interference with activities of daily living.\n\nAnswer C: Normal aging does not involve a noticeable decline in cognition and does not involve neurologic deficits. Declines are present, but are infrequent and do not impede activities of daily living.\n\nAnswer D: Pseudodementia is the result of untreated depression, which can present as forgetfulness in the elderly. This etiology can be distinguished by screening for signs or symptoms of depression, which might include sleep disturbance, anhedonia, lack of energy, increased or decreased appetite, fatigue, and/or loss of concentration. These symptoms are absent in this case.\n\nBullet Summary:\nVascular dementia presents with a step-wise decline in executive cognitive function and neurologic deficits in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors and is associate with MRI findings including white matter changes consistent with vascular infarcts.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. These are all risk factors for vascular issues, like strokes or small vessel disease. His main concerns are cognitive decline with problems in organizing, planning, and impulse control over the last month. His wife also mentions he needs reminders for daily tasks. However, he can still do ADLs without help, which is a good point.\n\nNow, the physical exam shows left-sided weakness in upper and lower extremities, which started three months ago. There's also a pronator drift on the left. That suggests a neurological deficit, possibly from a stroke or some kind of lesion. The mini-mental status exam shows he remembered 2 out of 3 words after 4 minutes, which is a bit concerning, but the clock drawing was normal. The MRI is shown in Figure A, which I can't see, but the question probably expects me to infer based on the clinical picture.\n\nLooking at the options: Alzheimer's typically presents with memory loss as the primary symptom, but here the cognitive issues are more about executive functions (planning, organizing) and there's a clear neurological deficit. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a milder form, but the physical signs might point elsewhere. Normal aging wouldn't explain the weakness or the specific cognitive deficits. Pseudodementia is usually due to depression, but there's no mention of depression here. Vascular dementia is caused by strokes or vascular damage. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increases the risk. The left-sided weakness and pronator drift suggest a stroke or infarct, which would support vascular dementia. The timing of the weakness starting three months ago and the cognitive decline in the last month could align with post-stroke cognitive issues. So the most likely answer is E, vascular dementia.\n</think>\n\nE",

In hemodynamically stable patients with a relative contraindication to \u03b2-blockers (COPD on home oxygen with increasing oxygen need), rate control with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil is preferred.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. ECG findings will be an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves with an erratic baseline as shown in Illustration A. Treatment is centered on rate control. First-line agents for rate control include \u03b21 selective blockers (metoprolol and esmolol) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem). In patients with COPD, non-selective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, timolol, and sotalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction by activating \u03b22-adrenoreceptors. Other relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers include Raynaud disease and depression (increased risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction). In patients with relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred initial treatment option.\n\nVan Gelder et al. studied lenient (resting heart rate < 110 beats per minute) versus strict rate control (resting heart rate < 80 beats per minute) in patients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized control trial. The authors found that there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmias between the 2 groups. The authors recommend a lenient rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG lacking P waves (red arrows) and irregularly irregular RR intervals (red/blue lines), which are classic findings in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic that can be used in patients to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is often suitable to use in patients with depressed left ventricular function. Amiodarone has multiple multi-system adverse effects including pulmonary toxicity, and it is not used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer B: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Although patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, the preferred anticoagulation agents are warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban).\n\nAnswer C: Digoxin can be used as a rate control agent in atrial fibrillation as it directly suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of toxicity, it is used as second-line therapy when first-line agents fail.\n\nAnswer D: Metoprolol is a \u03b2-blocker that is a first-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice.

The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

The patient is a 65-year-old man with sudden-onset altered mental status, slurred speech, and left facial drooping, plus right-sided weakness. His history includes diabetes and atrial fibrillation on warfarin. The key here is the sudden onset of neuro symptoms. The first thought is stroke, either ischemic or hemorrhagic.\n\nThe options are Alteplase (tPA), CT head, fingerstick glucose, FFP and vit K, or MRI. \n\nFirst, the immediate next step. The patient is on warfarin, so INR is a concern. But before anything else, we need to rule out hemorrhage because tPA can't be given if there's bleeding. So a CT head is critical to check for hemorrhage first. But wait, the options have both CT and MRI. In acute stroke, CT is the initial imaging because it's faster and can quickly show hemorrhage. MRI might be better for ischemic but takes longer. Since he's on anticoagulants, the risk of hemorrhage is high, so CT is needed to exclude that before considering tPA. \n\nAlso, the patient's mental status change and weakness could be due to hypoglycemia, so checking blood glucose is important. But the question asks for the most appropriate next step. The options are between B (CT) and C (glucose). Hypoglycemia can present with confusion and neuro changes, but given the focal signs (facial droop, unilateral weakness), stroke is more likely. However, checking glucose is quick and essential because treating hypoglycemia is straightforward. But in the context of possible stroke, the priority might be imaging. \n\nWait, the question says \"in addition to further physical exam, which is the most appropriate next step\". So they want the next diagnostic or treatment step. The standard approach for stroke is ABCs, then get a CT head to rule out bleed before giving tPA. Also, since he's on warfarin, his INR is likely elevated, so FFP and vit K (option D) might be needed if there's a bleed, but first you need to confirm with CT. \n\nSo the immediate steps would be: check glucose (quick), then CT head. But the options are separate. The question is which is the most appropriate. The answer might be CT head (B) because it's critical to assess for hemorrhage before considering tPA.",

Compression of the nerve leads to symptoms along the plantar surface of the foot which can include pain, tingling, or numbness. These symptoms can be exacerbated/triggered by tapping on the tunnel, which lies posterior to the medial malleolus. In addition, the symptoms can occur at rest or during activity and are not improved with rest. Treatment is rest, NSAIDs, properly fitted shoes/orthotics, and in refractory cases, surgical release of the tarsal tunnel.\n\nGould reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of tarsal tunnel syndrome. He discusses how this syndrome represents a collection of different entities including space-filling lesions and local inflammation. He recommends definitive diagnosis prior to surgical treatment given that the syndrome is often misdiagnosed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Common fibular nerve compression typically occurs when there is trauma/compression just inferior to the head of the fibula. This can occur when an individual wears work boots and after fractures of the fibular neck. Symptoms of common fibular nerve compression include foot drop and numbness on the dorsum of the foot. Treatment is with activity modification and a foot orthosis to prevent an equinus contracture.\n\nAnswer B: Herniated disc presents with symptoms of radiculopathy including pain that travels down the leg through the toes. Symptoms are worsened with flexion of the leg such as during the straight leg raise test. Treatment is with NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections with surgical decompression of the disc in refractory cases.\n\nAnswer C: Plantar fasciitis can present very similarly to tarsal tunnel syndrome with pain along the plantar surface of the foot. The pain is typically exacerbated by activity and improves with rest in contrast to this patient. In addition, there is an absence of burning, pain, and numbness that occur in tarsal tunnel syndrome. Tenderness will be at the medial insertion of the plantar fascia into the calcaneal tuberosity. Treatment is conservative with NSAIDs and activity modification.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B12 deficiency could present with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. This is possible given this patient's vegan diet. This patient has pain only in one of his feet and he does not have symptoms of anemia such as fatigue or pallor.

But the question mentions burning and numbness, which are more neurological. Plantar fasciitis is more of a mechanical issue, so maybe not C.\n\nTarsal tunnel syndrome involves compression of the posterior tibial nerve, leading to tingling, numbness, and burning along the sole (plantar surface). That fits with the symptoms here. The patient's history of multiple lower extremity surgeries might contribute to nerve compression, but the key is the numbness/tingling.\n\nCommon fibular nerve compression would affect the dorsum of the foot more, maybe leading to weakness in dorsiflexion, but the exam shows 5/5 strength.

But the exam doesn't mention back pain or other neurological signs like weakness in specific muscles. Plus, the numbness is specifically on the plantar side, which might align more with tarsal tunnel.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency can cause neuropathy, leading to numbness and tingling. Since he's vegan, that's a possibility because B12 is mainly in animal products. However, the symptoms here are localized to the foot, whereas B12 deficiency usually causes more generalized neuropathy. Also, the timing with running might not link directly to B12 unless it's acute, but the question doesn't mention other symptoms like fatigue or megaloblastic anemia.\n\nSo between D (tars",

        "reason": "This patient presents with hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, and multiple follicles on pelvic ultrasound, which is most consistent with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is associated with an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma.\n\nPCOS is an acquired endocrinopathy characterized by ovarian dysfunction and high rates of amenorrhea. Patients with PCOS are at risk for endometrial carcinoma due to unopposed estrogen exposure. Anovulation results in decreased progesterone, which prevents excessive endometrial build-up and thus increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent carcinoma. Increased adiposity in PCOS also increases estrogen, which is aromatized from testosterone in adipose cells, and further raises the risk for endometrial carcinoma. Treatment is with weight loss, metformin, and hormonal contraceptives.\n\nKhan et al. review the genetic basis underlying PCOS. They discuss how this disease is the most common endocrinopathy in reproductive-age women resulting in anovulatory infertility. They recommend using multimodal methods to treat this disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows a transvaginal ultrasound of the ovary with many peripheral follicles (red circle). These findings are characteristic of PCOS.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ovarian cancer does not occur with increased incidence in patients with PCOS. They are at baseline risk and do not require additional screening. The rates of ovarian cancer increase with hereditary cancer syndromes such as BRCA mutation.\n\nAnswer C: Ovarian cyst rupture is not a complication of PCOS, as PCOS does not actually cause cysts (despite the name). The cystic spaces seen on ultrasound are immature follicles rather than cysts. Recurrent infections can lead to cysts and rupture.\n\nAnswer D: Type 1 diabetes mellitus is not associated with PCOS, but type 2 diabetes mellitus is. Type 2 diabetes can cause acanthosis nigricans via insulin resistance. Patients with recurrent bouts of pancreatitis are predisposed to diabetes mellitus.\n\nAnswer E: Virilization is not seen in PCOS, as the testosterone levels are elevated but not to the degree necessary to produce frank masculinization. If there is evidence of virilization, such as voice deepening or clitoromegaly the differential should be broadened to other diagnoses.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with PCOS are at increased risk of endometrial carcinoma as a result of unopposed estrogen from anovulation as well as aromatization in adipose tissue.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 25-year-old woman with hirsutism, recent weight gain, irregular periods, and acanthosis nigricans. Her blood pressure is a bit high at 136/86. The pelvic exam shows a normal uterus, and the ultrasound is mentioned but the figure isn't available. The question is about her increased future risk.\n\nFirst, the symptoms: hirsutism and acne (though not mentioned here) are common in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Acanthosis nigricans is associated with insulin resistance, which is also part of PCOS. Irregular periods and weight gain are classic PCOS symptoms. High BMI (26 is overweight) adds to that. The options given are endometrial carcinoma, ovarian cancer, ovarian cyst rupture, type 1 diabetes, and virilization.\n\nPCOS is linked to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, not type 1. So option D is possible but type 1 is autoimmune, so maybe not. Endometrial carcinoma risk comes from unopposed estrogen, like in anovulatory cycles (as in PCOS), so that's a risk. Ovarian cancer isn't linked to PCOS. Ovarian cyst rupture could happen, but that's more an acute issue, not a long-term risk. Virilization is more about masculinization due to androgens, which can occur in PCOS but she's already presenting with hirsutism, so maybe E is a current issue, not a future risk. The question asks for future risk. So between A and D. Since she's young, endometrial cancer might be less immediate, but long-term anovulation can cause endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Type 2 diabetes is more likely than type 1. The options have D as type 1, so that's not it. So the answer is A? Wait, but the options are (A) Endometrial carcinoma, (D) Type 1 DM. Since the question is about increased future risk, PCOS patients have higher risk of endometrial cancer due to chronic estrogen without progesterone, leading to hyperplasia. Also, type 2 diabetes, but the option given is type 1, so D is not correct. So the answer should be A. Alternatively, maybe the acanthosis nigricans points more to insulin resistance",

Evaluation begins with a primary and secondary trauma survey to assess for other injuries. Hard signs of vascular injury include pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematoma, and absent pulses distal to the wound. For patients with suspected vascular injury that display either hard signs or hemodynamic instability, emergent surgical intervention is the most appropriate next step in management. For those with soft signs of vascular injury such as non-pulsatile bleeding or associated bony injury, the most appropriate next step in management is CT angiography of the affected limb.\n\nBall et al. discuss penetrating trauma to the extremities. They state that extremity trauma is the most common source of vascular injury (51%), with femoral artery as the most frequently injured vessel (35%). They also state that though obtaining pulses is important, distal pulses can continue to be present in many limbs with arterial injuries and therefore may require confirmatory evaluation via doppler, CT scan, or even angiography.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Angiography of the left lower extremity may be utilized if this patient did not present with hard signs of vascular injury.

His vitals show a fast heart rate (130) and low blood pressure (85/50), which indicates he's in shock. The FAST exam is negative, so no internal abdominal or chest bleeding. But when they remove pressure from the wound, there's pulsatile bleeding. \n\nPulsatile bleeding usually means an artery is involved.

        "reason": "This patient with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, deviation of the tongue to the right, left-sided hemiparesis, and decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the left side of his body most likely has a stroke of the right medial medulla. The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome). This leads to lesions to the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Clinically this presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased gag reflex, vomiting, vertigo, decreased pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which presents with ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities, and contralateral loss of light touch and vibration sensation.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 67-year-old man with sudden onset of difficulty speaking, eating, left-sided weakness, and a deviating tongue. His medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, which are risk factors for stroke. The physical exam shows right tongue deviation, left-sided weakness (3/5), and sensory deficits on the left.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the type of stroke and the affected artery. The symptoms point to a stroke given the sudden onset. The left-sided weakness suggests a right hemisphere lesion because the brain controls the opposite side of the body. The tongue deviation to the right also indicates a right-sided lesion, as the tongue muscles are controlled by the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), which originates in the medulla on the same side. So a right hypoglossal nerve palsy would cause the tongue to deviate to the right.\n\nNow, the sensory deficits on the left side (decreased light touch and vibration) suggest involvement of the spinothalamic and posterior columns, which are part of the sensory pathways. The spinothalamic tract crosses early, so a lesion on the right would affect the left side. The posterior columns don't cross until higher up, so a lesion in the spinal cord might also cause sensory issues, but the presence of cranial nerve involvement (tongue) and upper motor neuron signs (weakness) points more to a brainstem issue.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA): This supplies parts of the cerebellum, pons, and brainstem. AICA stroke might cause vertigo, vomiting, facial numbness, but maybe not the tongue deviation and contralateral weakness as described here.\n\nB) Anterior spinal artery: This affects the spinal cord, leading to motor and sensory deficits below a certain level, but the cranial nerve issues here are more brainstem.\n\nC) Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery: These are small arteries that supply the basal ganglia and internal capsule. A blockage here (lacunar stroke) can cause pure motor stroke, maybe with contralateral weakness, but typically without the tongue deviation unless involving the internal capsule more. However, the sensory deficits might be present here too. But the tongue deviation to the right suggests a lower motor neuron lesion in the hypoglossal nucleus in the medulla, which is part of the brainstem.\n\nD",

The most accurate diagnostic test for early ankylosing spondylitis is MRI.\n\nMultiple imaging tests can diagnose ankylosing spondylitis. Radiographs of the spine will show squaring of vertebrae with vertical or marginal syndesmophytes resulting in a \"bamboo spine\" appearance. The earliest radiographic sign is the erosion of the iliac side of the sacroiliac joint, but this finding is not sensitive in the early stages of the disease. MRI is sensitive in detecting sacroiliac inflammation, which makes this the best modality for early detection of ankylosing spondylitis in young patients. Initial therapy for ankylosing spondylitis includes lifestyle modifications (exercise, smoking cessation, physical therapy) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Therapy for patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs includes tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) and interleukin 17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab).\n\nJung et al. studied whether signs of inflammation on MRI are correlated with bone quality in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The authors find that bone marrow edema is negatively correlated with the trabecular bone score. The authors recommend control of active bone inflammation to prevent osteoporosis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bone scan will show inflammation in the sacroiliac joints, but this study lacks specificity for this disease compared with other inflammatory forms of arthritis.\n\nAnswer B: CT will show bony changes but not active inflammation, so it is most commonly used to diagnose cervical fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. While it can support the diagnosis, it is less accurate than an MRI.\n\nAnswer D: Radiographs will show erosion of the iliac side of the sacroiliac joint, but this finding is not sensitive in the early stages of the disease when bony ankylosis has not yet occurred. Radiographs may be an appropriate initial test.\n\nAnswer E: Ultrasound is useful in evaluating muscle strains or tendon tears; however, it is not able to detect bony abnormalities and is therefore of limited use in ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMRI is the most sensitive and accurate test for the early detection of ankylosing spondylitis.",

The pain started after lifting boxes, but it's been getting worse. The key points here are that the pain is worse in the mornings and after rest, which improves with activity. That's a classic presentation for inflammatory back pain, which is different from mechanical back pain. Mechanical pain usually gets worse with activity and better with rest, but here it's the opposite.\n\nHe's been taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which are over-the-counter meds. His vitals are normal except for the elevated ESR and CRP, both of which are markers of inflammation. The physical exam shows limited spinal flexion and extension, and tenderness over the patellar tendon insertions. The tenderness at tendon insertions makes me think of enthesitis, which is inflammation at the sites where tendons or ligaments attach to bone. That's a feature seen in spondyloarthropathies like ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis typically affects younger males, presents with chronic back pain that improves with exercise, and has inflammatory markers like elevated ESR and CRP. The morning stiffness and improvement with activity are also red flags for this condition. The patellar tendon involvement (enthesitis) adds to that suspicion.\n\nNow, the question is about the most accurate test. The options are bone scan, CT, MRI, radiograph, or ultrasound. Let's think about each:\n\nRadiographs (option D) might show changes like sacroiliitis in later stages, but early on, they might be normal. Since the patient has only had symptoms for 6 months, radiographic changes might not be evident yet. MRI (option C) is more sensitive for detecting early inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints and spine, which is crucial in diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis. MRI can show bone edema and inflammation before structural changes occur on X-rays.\n\nCT (B) is better for bony detail but not as good for early inflammation. Bone scans (A) can detect increased activity but are less specific. Ultrasound (E) might be used for entheseal areas but isn't the best for spinal assessment here.\n\nSo the best test here would be MRI (C) to look for early sacroiliitis and spinal inflammation.

Abdominal radiography typically shows dilated loops of the small intestine proximal to the obstruction. Enema with water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin) is both diagnostic and therapeutic, as the contrast not only visualizes a microcolon but also relieves the obstruction via the osmotic pull of water into the lumen of the colon.

That's a key test here. \n\nAlternatively, if they suspect meconium ileus (like in CF), contrast enema can also show the \"soap bubble\" appearance. But the sibling has Down syndrome, which is a risk factor for both Hirschsprung and CF. However, the mother declined prenatal testing, so maybe not confirmed. \n\nThe next step after the plain film (which might show distended bowel and transition point) would be a contrast enema to confirm Hirschsprung. The rectal biopsy is diagnostic but maybe after imaging. The contrast enema can both diagnose and sometimes treat by relieving the obstruction. \n\nSweat testing (D) is for CF, but that's usually done if there's suspicion based on other factors. Upper",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with chest pain and an ECG demonstrating hyperacute T waves (leads V2-V6) which is an early finding concerning for a myocardial infarction.\n\nA myocardial infarction occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures causing occlusion of a coronary artery. Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI. The authors note that T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression can before, during, or after the STEMI event. The authors recommend obtaining serial ECGs in patients with suspected STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates hyperacute T waves (blue arrows) that are only occurring in a vascular distribution (V2-V6).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia can present with peaked T waves; however, peaked T waves would be demonstrated in all leads. Other findings of hyperkalemia can include QRS widening. Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias. Repletion with potassium is the preferred treatment, and the magnesium level should be checked as low magnesium can lead to potassium wasting in the kidneys.\n\nAnswer E: Pericarditis presents with chest pain worse by laying back and relieved by leaning forward. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions, and echocardiography may demonstrate a pericardial effusion. Management involves the administration of ibuprofen or colchicine and steroids in refractory cases. However, these therapies should not be used after myocardial infarction.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHyperacute T waves are an early finding that is concerning for myocardial infarction.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 50-year-old man with chest pain. The key points here are the characteristics of the pain, associated symptoms, medical history, and the ECG (even though I can't see Figure A, maybe the description will help). \n\nFirst, the chest pain is dull, started 30 minutes ago, worsening gradually, and worse with exertion. He also mentions it's worse when leaning back and better when leaning forward. That positional change is a red flag. Oh, and he fainted, which is syncope. His history includes diabetes and hypertension, on metformin and losartan. Vital signs: temp slightly elevated, BP 130/87, tachycardic (99), resp rate 22, O2 sat 100%. Physical exam shows he's overweight, normal heart sounds, clear lungs.\n\nHmm, the options are hyperkalemia, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), hypokalemia, MI, or pericarditis. Let's go through each.\n\nPericarditis often presents with sharp, pleuritic chest pain that's worse when lying down (so worse when leaning back, which matches) and better when sitting forward. The ECG in pericarditis typically shows diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions. The patient's syncope might be due to pericardial tamponade if there's a large effusion, but that's more acute. However, the ECG here might be key. \n\nMyocardial infarction (MI) usually has crushing, pressure-like pain, maybe radiating. The ECG would show ST elevations in specific leads (like STEMI) or other changes. The positional aspect isn't typical for MI. But the patient's BP is okay, and O2 sat is 100%, so maybe not an acute MI unless it's a non-ST elevation MI. But the positional change is more pericarditis.\n\nHypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy can cause syncope with exertion, but the pain being positional is less likely. HOCM might have a systolic murmur that changes with Valsalva, but the exam here says normal S1 and S2. \n\nHyperkalemia can cause chest pain but more as a complication of arrhythmias. The ECG changes for hyperkalemia include peaked T waves",

This is most likely due to exogenous testosterone from anabolic (androgenic) steroid use.\n\nYoung people (especially athletes and heavy weightlifters) looking to improve their physical performance may rely on the use of anabolic steroids (testosterone, boldenone, and stanozolol). These steroids adversely impair endogenous testicular function, causing infertility secondary to decreased testicular size and sperm count. Furthermore, hepatic dysfunction and cardiac dysfunction can occur at high doses. Excess testosterone is converted to estradiol, leading to breast enlargement and signs of gynecomastia. Aggression and mood disturbances may also occur in patients with excessive anabolic steroid use. Finally, skin findings of anabolic steroid use include accelerated male pattern baldness and acne. Patients should be counseled on avoiding these agents.\n\nVan Wagoner et al. study the chemical composition of products marketed as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). The authors find that less than half of the analyzed products contained compounds in the amount listed on the label. The authors recommend that clinicians counsel athletes and bodybuilders that these products are often mislabeled, are not regulated, and have not been shown to be safe or effective.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Cryptorchidism is the failure of testicular descent into the scrotum and typically manifests in infancy. While uncorrected cryptorchidism can be a cause of infertility, this is an unlikely diagnosis in a man with palpable testes. Furthermore, cryptorchidism would not explain this patient\u2019s receding hairline or gynecomastia.\n\nAnswer C: Excess growth hormone use should be suspected because growth hormone can be taken exogenously to improve athletic performance and can present with hypertension. This typically also presents with hyperglycemia and enlarged hands and feet.\n\nAnswer D: Klinefelter syndrome is an inherited disorder that also presents with infertility, gynecomastia, and decreased testicular size. This disorder also causes mental impairment and would not explain the patient\u2019s elevated aminotransferases.\n\nAnswer E: Myotonic dystrophy is a multi-system disorder that can also present with testicular atrophy, reduced fertility, and hair loss. Patients with myotonic dystrophy also have widespread muscular atrophy and weakness, as well as clinical features of myotonia (e.g., difficulty releasing a handshake).\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnabolic steroid use in men can cause reduced fertility by suppressing endogenous testosterone activity, and presents with gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, accelerated male balding patterns, and hepatotoxicity.",

His main symptoms include small testes, receding hairline, palpable tissue under his nipples (which might be gynecomastia), and lab results showing elevated liver enzymes (AST 410, ALT 275). He exercises a lot with heavy weightlifting and has a high-protein diet. He mentions occasional alcohol and remote marijuana use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible causes of infertility listed in the options. Let's go through each option:\n\nA) Anabolic steroid use: Steroids are often used by bodybuilders to increase muscle mass. They can cause infertility by suppressing testosterone production, leading to testicular atrophy. Also, anabolic steroids are known to cause gynecomastia and liver enzyme elevations (since they're metabolized by the liver). The patient's history of heavy weightlifting and high-protein diet makes steroid use plausible. The elevated AST and ALT support this, as steroids can cause hepatotoxicity.\n\nB) Cryptorchidism: This is undescended testes, usually from birth. It can lead to infertility, but the patient would likely have a history of it since childhood. The question doesn't mention any such history, so maybe less likely unless it's undiagnosed. But the physical exam shows small testes, which could be due to other causes too.\n\nC) Excess growth hormone: Acromegaly (excess GH) in adults can cause various issues, but infertility isn't the first thing that comes to mind. Symptoms like enlarged hands, facial features, maybe joint pain. Not sure how it directly affects infertility. The physical exam here doesn't mention those features, so maybe not the best fit.\n\nD) Klinefelter syndrome: This is a genetic condition where males have an extra X chromosome. Features include small testes, gynecomastia, infertility, and often tall stature with sparse body hair. However, Klinefelter's typically presents with elevated FSH and LH, and the patient might have learning disabilities or other features. The lab results here don't mention hormone levels, but the testes size and gynecomastia could fit. However, the liver enzymes are high here, which isn't a typical feature of Klinefelter's.\n\nE) Myotonic dystrophy: This is a muscular dystrophy causing muscle weakness and",

The baby was born without complications, and the mother doesn't smoke, but there's a cat at home.

The straight leg test can help confirm the diagnosis.\n\nA herniated disc classically presents in a middle-aged or older individual who was lifting a heavy object with improper form. They will typically experience lower back pain that can be described as radicular. The pain will typically travel down the legs or \"shoot down\" the legs and is typically described as feeling electrical. The straight leg test on physical exam supports the diagnosis without an MRI. When the individual raises their leg, this causes compression of the spinal nerve roots leading to an exacerbation of symptoms. The most appropriate initial step in management for these patients is limiting strenuous activity, physical therapy, and NSAIDs. Patients who have chronic symptoms that have failed conservative management can undergo surgical laminectomy.\n\nCamino and Piuzzi present the data regarding the diagnostic value of the straight leg raise test. They discuss how this test can exacerbate patients with radicular symptoms. They recommend all practitioners learn how to perform and interpret this test.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh is referred to as the FABER test and is used to evaluate for sacroiliitis which can present with lower back pain and pain in the buttocks. This exam maneuver will cause intense pain in patients who have inflammation of the joint. Treatment is with physical therapy and NSAIDs.\n\nAnswer B: Internal rotation of the extended hip is the Freiberg test which evaluates for piriformis syndrome. Piriformis syndrome presents with lower back pain similar to a herniated disc; however, is less likely to have occurred after a single lifting episode and does not typically present with electrical pain that originates in the buttocks.\n\nAnswer C: Palpating the paraspinal muscles is a non-specific test that could further support a diagnosis of a muscle strain. It will likely not provide much information in the diagnosis of a herniated disc. Patients with muscle strain can be treated conservatively with relative rest and NSAIDs.\n\nAnswer D: Radiography is unlikely to offer information regarding this patient's herniated disc. While it can detect bony abnormalities, the detail of this imaging modality will not depict a herniated disc. An MRI is required to offer the detail necessary to make the diagnosis and is the most accurate test for a herniated disc.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA herniated disc typically presents with pain in the lower back that radiates down the legs and is exacerbated by the straight leg raise test.",

The straight leg raise test (E) is the standard for assessing this. The other options don't fit as well.

He notes that ALL has a high cure rate with intensive chemotherapeutic regimens and that new research is improving outcomes in this very common condition. He recommends early treatment with these regimens for an improved prognosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Acute myelogenous leukemia is a malignancy of myeloblasts and is more common in the elderly. Patients will present with systemic symptoms, weight loss, anorexia, leukocytosis, anemia (causing fatigue), thrombocytopenia (causing bleeding including gingival bleeding and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract), and neutropenia (predisposing patients to life-threatening infection). Myeloblasts produce increased amounts of myeloperoxidase which can lead to the formation of Auer rods that can be seen on peripheral smear.\n\nAnswer C: Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells and presents with a leukocyte count > 50,000/mm3. There are different presentations for this condition. Most patients present in the chronic phase with minimal symptoms (and a low blast count); however, they can also present with an accelerated phase and a blast phase which can lead to a hematologic emergency termed a blast crisis which may cause a hyperviscosity syndrome.\n\nAnswer D: Leukemoid reaction is an overly robust immune reaction (often to infection) that resembles chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level is elevated. This elevated level indicates it is a robust immune response rather than increased cell levels from malignancy.\n\nAnswer E: Parvovirus B19 infection presents with erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) which may include \"slapped cheek\" rash, fever, malaise, and possibly respiratory symptoms. In healthy patients, symptoms are usually minimal and self-limited. However, in patients with hemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease), the transient halt in erythropoiesis that occurs in addition to hemolysis may lead to significant anemia requiring transfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia presents in pediatric patients with pancytopenia, fatigue, repeat infections, easy bleeding, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and increased blast cells on peripheral smear.",

His physical exam shows lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The lab results are key here.\n\nFirst, looking at the blood counts: the hemoglobin is low (8 g/dL), which is anemia. The hematocrit is 23%, which aligns with that. The leukocyte count is super high at 27,500/mm3, which is way above normal for a child. But what's interesting is that 35% of those are lymphoblasts. Lymphoblasts are immature white blood cells typically seen in certain leukemias. The platelet count is also low at 49,000, which is thrombocytopenia.\n\nNow, the options given are various leukemias and other conditions. Let's go through them. \n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood leukemia. It presents with high WBC counts, often with lymphoblasts. The presence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and the blast percentage here (35%) all point towards ALL. \n\nAcute myelogenous leukemia (AML) would have myeloblasts instead of lymphoblasts. The high percentage here is lymphoblasts, so that might lean away from AML. \n\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is more common in adults and presents with a higher WBC count but usually with more mature cells, and the blast percentage is lower. Also, CML often has a specific genetic marker like the Philadelphia chromosome. Since the patient is a child, CML is less likely. \n\nLeukemoid reaction is a reactive leukocytosis, often due to infection. However, in leukemoid reaction, the WBC count is elevated but without blasts. The presence of 35% lymphoblasts here is a red flag against that. \n\nParvovirus B19 can cause aplastic crisis, leading to severe anemia, but typically in someone with underlying anemia like sickle cell. It might cause low platelets too, but the presence of blasts in the blood isn't typical for parvovirus. \n\nPutting it all together, the high lymphoblast percentage,",

Given the likely diagnosis of transient proteinuria, the most appropriate next step is to repeat the urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon.\n\nTransient proteinuria can be due to febrile illnesses, seizures, strenuous exercise, emotional stress, serious illnesses like heart failure, and abdominal surgery. A detailed workup is not needed if the clinical story is clear, but an orthostatic test can be completed. One way to do this is to assess the urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon. Another way requires the patient to collect urine at multiple times throughout the day. A diagnosis is confirmed if the morning sample is protein-free but the evening sample contains protein. In general, pediatric patients with orthostatic proteinuria should have under 1 gram of protein in a full 24 hours.

Patients will have edema, hematuria, or dysuria.\n\nAnswer C: Repeat urinalysis will not change the presence of proteinuria. Generally, a patient who has proteinuria should have a repeat urinalysis performed to rule out transient proteinuria. If the repeat urinalysis demonstrates proteinuria (as in this patient), then the diagnosis is unlikely to be transient proteinuria, and further workup is needed.\n\nAnswer E: Urine electrolytes and creatinine will assess the kidney's ability to concentrate urine and assess the etiology of acute kidney injury.

He's not having any abdominal pain, fever, or other symptoms like nausea or vomiting. He's even back to playing basketball, which suggests he's recovering well. The main thing here is his urine appearing more amber, and he thinks it's due to dehydration. The initial urinalysis shows 3+ protein, 3 WBCs/hpf, but negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites. After three days, the follow-up urinalysis is similar.\n\nHmm, the question is asking for the next step. The options are CT scan, renal biopsy, repeat urinalysis, urine dipstick at different times, or urine electrolytes and creatinine.\n\nFirst, let's break down the urinalysis results. The protein is 3+, which is significant proteinuria. The WBCs are 3/hpf, which is a bit elevated but not super high. However, since nitrites and leukocyte esterase are negative, that makes a urinary tract infection (UTI) less likely. Because nitrites are typically positive in UTIs caused by gram-negative bacteria, and leukocyte esterase would be positive if there were lots of white blood cells. So maybe the WBCs aren't from an infection. \n\nThe patient's symptoms don't suggest a UTI either\u2014he has no fever, pain, or other signs. The dehydration he mentions might explain the darker urine, but the protein and WBCs are more concerning. Since he had an appendectomy recently, could there be any post-surgical issue? But the incision sites are clean, so probably not an infection there.\n\nNow, the proteinuria is 3+, which is a lot. Possible causes could be dehydration (since that can cause transient proteinuria), but also maybe orthostatic proteinuria, which is common in adolescents. Orthostatic proteinuria presents with protein in the urine when standing but not in the morning. So maybe testing first-morning urine versus another sample would help. The options include D: urine dipstick in the morning and afternoon. That makes sense because if it's orthostatic, the morning sample might be negative, and the afternoon positive. \n\nAlternatively, could it be a kidney issue? The fact that the urinalysis is similar on follow-up might suggest it's persistent. But the absence of other symptoms like hypertension or edema (since he's active",

Since this patient has failed therapy with oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), she should undergo laparoscopy.\n\nEndometriosis classically presents with chronic pelvic pain and the \u201c3 D symptoms\u201d of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia. Since laparoscopy with biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis, patients with suspected endometriosis may be empirically managed with OCPs and NSAIDs. Most patients achieve symptom control on this regimen. If patients fail empiric therapy, have contraindications to hormonal therapy, or have severe symptoms they should undergo laparoscopy for both definitive diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\n\nVercellini et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. They discuss how the diagnosis of this disorder is carried out by direct visualization and histologic examination of lesions. They recommend medical treatment for symptomatic relief and surgical excision in refractory patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal ultrasound is less accurate than a transvaginal ultrasound which has already been performed. Since there were no findings on transvaginal ultrasound, it is unlikely that abdominal ultrasound would reveal pathology. This modality would be effective for intra-abdominal disorders such as cholelithiasis or appendicitis (in pediatric and pregnant patients to avoid radiation exposure).\n\nAnswer B: Hysterosalpingogram is more useful in the workup of infertility, particularly for patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. It is not routinely used to diagnose endometriosis. Patients with pelvic inflammatory disease present with fever, purulent discharge, and cervical motion tenderness. Treatment is with antibiotics.\n\nAnswer C: Hysteroscopy is used in the workup of abnormal uterine bleeding, fibroids, and endometrial thickening or polyps. Since endometriosis is defined as endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine cavity, a hysteroscopy is not particularly helpful in making the diagnosis. Treatment for polyps or fibroids is with surgical excision.\n\nAnswer E: Pelvic MRI can be used to better characterize an abnormality seen on pelvic ultrasound or CT or to diagnose adenomyosis. It can aid in making the diagnosis of endometriosis but is not the most accurate/confirmatory test. A laparoscopy would both be diagnostic and therapeutic for this disorder.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with suspected endometriosis may be managed empirically with oral contraceptive pills and NSAIDs, but laparoscopy with biopsy is necessary for definitive diagnosis and management.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 32-year-old woman with chronic pelvic pain worsening premenstrually and dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) for the past two months. She had a copper IUD which was removed a year ago due to menorrhagia, now on OCPs which helped with bleeding but not pain. The pelvic exam shows pain with lateral displacement of the cervix, which is a sign I remember is Adenexal tenderness, maybe indicating something on the ovaries or fallopian tubes. The ultrasound was normal, and pregnancy test is negative.\n\nThe question is asking which test would confirm the diagnosis. The options are abdominal ultrasound, hysterosalpingogram, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, or pelvic MRI.\n\nFirst, let's think about possible diagnoses. The symptoms of chronic pelvic pain worse before menses and dyspareunia make me think of endometriosis. Endometriosis can cause these symptoms, and the pain with lateral displacement (which is a maneuver to check for adnexal tenderness) might suggest lesions in that area. The patient had an IUD, but it was removed, so maybe the IUD wasn't the cause anymore. Since the pelvic ultrasound didn't show anything, but endometriosis can sometimes be seen on ultrasound, maybe not always. \n\nOther possibilities could be pelvic inflammatory disease, but she denies dysuria, discharge, pruritus, so that's less likely. Adenomyosis? That's when endometrial tissue is in the myometrium, but that's more associated with dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. She's on OCPs which help with bleeding but not pain, so maybe adenomyosis is possible, but again, the ultrasound was normal. \n\nAnother thought: maybe uterine fibroids, but again, the ultrasound didn't show anything. The pain with lateral displacement could also point to ovarian endometrioma (chocolate cyst), but if the ultrasound was normal, maybe it's early or not a cyst yet. \n\nThe key here is that the pelvic ultrasound was normal. So if the initial imaging didn't find anything, but the clinical suspicion is high for endometriosis, the next step would be laparoscopy. Because laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis. Hysteroscopy is more for looking inside the uterus, like for polyps",

The question is asking about the most likely risk factor for his presenting condition, and the options are alcohol, antibiotics, IV drug use, poor dental hygiene, or sexual intercourse.\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out what the presenting condition might be based on the physical exam finding in Figure A. Since I can't see the figure, I have to think of common exam findings that might be linked to the given options. The patient's vital signs are mostly normal except for a slightly elevated temperature (99.5\u00b0F) and a heart rate of 90, which is a bit on the high side. But the key here is the physical exam finding. Let's consider each option's association with possible conditions.\n\nOption C is intravenous drug use. IV drug users are at risk for infections like endocarditis, abscesses, or maybe something like cellulitis. If the physical exam showed something like a new heart murmur, skin lesions, or signs of infection, that could point to IV drug use as a risk factor. \n\nOption D is poor dental hygiene, which is a risk factor for endocarditis as well, especially if there's a history of dental procedures without prophylaxis. But maybe the finding is something like a murmur or splinter hemorrhages, which are signs of endocarditis. Alternatively, poor dental hygiene could lead to other issues like periodontal disease, but that might not be the main concern here.\n\nOption B, antibiotic use, could be linked to Clostridium difficile infection or other antibiotic-associated colitis, but the physical exam finding would need to be something like abdominal tenderness or diarrhea. The vitals here don't show diarrhea, though.\n\nOption A, alcohol consumption, could be related to liver issues, but again, without more info on the physical exam, it's hard to say. Maybe jaundice or ascites, but those aren't mentioned here.\n\nOption E, sexual intercourse, might be linked to STIs, but again, the exam finding would need to point to that, like genital ulcers or lymphadenopathy.\n\nWait, the patient is on lithium.

If his blood glucose isn't given, but assuming it's normal, 49 might be okay. Wait, but in bacterial meningitis, glucose is typically low because the bacteria consume glucose. So if the glucose is normal, maybe it's viral? But the protein is 55, which is a bit high but not super high. Hmm.\n\nWait, the options are about treatment.

Further delineation guides treatment and informs prognosis. UC has a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. It is characterized by disease extending from the rectum proximally towards the ileocecal valve in a continuous fashion. UC presents as mucosal and submucosal inflammation, with characteristic crypt distortion and presence of crypt abscesses. P-ANCA is positive in most individuals with UC. Repeated mucosal injury can induce pseudopolyp formation, and pancolitis or disease in the descending colon warrants screening colonoscopy due to increased risk of colon cancer.

Her family history includes a mother with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which is important because PSC is often associated with ulcerative colitis. The physical exam shows mild diffuse tenderness, but no distension. The colonoscopy finding isn't described here, but we know she has positive p-ANCA antibodies.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the differences between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The key points here are the clinical presentation and the lab findings. p-ANCA is more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis, whereas anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) is more common in Crohn's. The family history of PSC in the mother also points towards ulcerative colitis since PSC is a known complication of UC.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) Cobblestoning and skip lesions: These are features of Crohn's disease. Cobblestone appearance is due to inflammation and healing, and skip lesions mean areas of normal intestine between affected areas. Since the patient's ANCA is positive, this might not be the right answer.\n\nB) Continuous lesion beginning in the rectum: This is classic for ulcerative colitis. UC typically starts in the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous manner. The presence of bloody diarrhea also fits with UC, as it's usually more distal.\n\nC) Fistulae and stricture formation: These are more characteristic of Crohn's disease. Fistulas can form between loops of bowel or to other organs, and strictures due to fibrosis. Since the question mentions the mother's PSC, which is linked to UC, this might not be the case here.\n\nD) Perianal disease: Perianal involvement like fissures or abscesses is more common in Crohn's than UC. UC usually spares the perianal area, so this might not be the answer.\n\nE) Worse disease severity near the ileocecal valve: That sounds like Crohn's, especially if it's at the terminal ileum. UC usually affects the colon, starting from the rectum. However, the ileocecal area could be involved in some cases, but the key here is the continuous involvement starting at the rectum.\n\nPutting it all together: The patient's positive p-ANCA",

The most appropriate initial step in management is to treat the patient with an SSRI for at least 4 weeks since SSRI's take several weeks to reach their potential. If the treatment has failed after 4 weeks of use, altering the patient's medications could be appropriate. Treatment and side effects should be monitored by a physician.\n\nKato et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of depression with SSRI medications.

They recommend not allowing patients to switch between drug classes too early.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Adding lithium to the treatment regimen could be an appropriate treatment if this patient had failed to respond to therapy after 4 weeks of using the drug. Lithium is an augmenting agent that could potentiate the effect of an SSRI.\n\nAnswer B: Changing the treatment to duloxetine would be inappropriate as this patient has not taken the first-line SSRI for at least 4 weeks. Patients should try a full treatment course in order to determine if they may derive some benefit.\n\nAnswer C: Changing the treatment to lithium would be appropriate if this patient's diagnosis was bipolar disorder, which would present with episodes of depression and mania.

The patient is a 23-year-old woman with symptoms of fatigue, anhedonia (loss of interest in activities she used to enjoy), psychomotor retardation (heavy limbs and difficulty moving), insomnia, and impaired functioning at work and school. She was started on first-line therapy but hasn't improved after a week.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the first-line treatments for depression are. Typically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline, fluoxetine, or SNRIs like venlafaxine are first-line. Since the question mentions she's on first-line therapy but not responding, the next steps would involve considering a change in medication, augmentation, or other treatments.\n\nThe options given are adding lithium (A), switching to duloxetine (B), switching to lithium (C), continuing current therapy (D), or ECT (E). \n\nThe key here is the time frame. Antidepressants usually take 2-4 weeks to show improvement. A week is too short to determine if the medication isn't working. The answer might be D (continue therapy) because it's too early. However, the question says she's returning a week later and her symptoms haven't improved. But maybe the first-line treatment needs more time. Alternatively, maybe the initial medication wasn't effective, so a switch is needed.\n\nDuloxetine is an SNRI, which is also a first-line option. If the current first-line was an SSRI, switching to an SNRI (duloxetine) could be appropriate. Lithium is often used as an augmenting agent in treatment-resistant depression, but adding it (option A) might be considered. However, the question says \"change treatment\" in options B and C. \n\nWait, the question states she was started on appropriate first-line therapy. If after a week there's no improvement, but the standard time is 2-4 weeks, maybe the correct answer is D, continue therapy. However, sometimes if there's no response after 4-6 weeks, then you switch. Since it's only a week, continuing is better. But the options might be testing that. Alternatively, maybe the question is implying that the first-line didn't work, so they need to switch. But the timing is crucial here. \n\nThe options don't mention increasing the dose, which is another possibility.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with exertional chest pain that is relieved with rest without increasing frequency or intensity of chest pain, a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), and normal troponin level most likely has stable angina.\n\nAngina pectoris is chest pain secondary to myocardial ischemia and is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, though it can be caused by any etiology leading to narrowing of the coronary arteries. The pain tends to be substernal, dull, squeezing, or pressure-like and can also radiate to the neck or arm. It may also be associated with shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting, or diaphoresis. In stable angina, the chest pain is precipitated by exertion or stress and is consistently relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. ECG tends to be normal, and troponin I levels are not elevated. Treatment of stable angina includes beta blockers and nitrates (for episodes of pain), as well as therapy to prevent disease progression disease progression which may include antiplatelet therapy (aspirin), lipid-lowering medications, and glycemic control. Lifestyle measures are also the mainstay of therapy and may include smoking cessation, exercise, and dietary modification.\n\nJoshi and de Lemos review stable angina. They note the optimal management of this condition. They recommend lifestyle interventions, lipid-lowering therapy, and antiplatelets to reduce morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure A shows an electrocardiogram with regular rate and rhythm. Every P wave is followed by a narrow QRS complex, which is consistent with normal sinus rhythm.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Costochondritis presents with pain of the chest wall that can be sharp, aching, or pressure-like and typically worsens with cough or deep breathing. It is typically caused by injury to the chest, physical strain, or can be associated with inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. On exam, the pain can be reproduced with palpation of the chest wall, in particular, the costochondral junction. This patient's chest pain is associated with exertion and relieved with rest, and his pain is not reproduced upon palpation of the chest wall. Thus, he is unlikely to have costochondritis.\n\nAnswer B: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction presents similarly to unstable angina with substernal chest pain that is new-onset, accelerating, or occurring at rest, without ST elevations on ECG. However, ST depressions or T wave inversions may be present on ECG, and troponin I and creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) would be elevated, indicating myocardial injury.\n\nAnswer C: ST-elevation myocardial infarction presents with acute onset substernal chest pain that can radiate to the neck, arm, shoulders, or jaw and is sometimes associated with diaphoresis, nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or anxiety. ECG shows ST elevations in a vascular distribution, and troponin I and CK-MB levels are elevated. This patient's ECG does not show ST elevations, and his symptoms are more consistent with stable angina.\n\nAnswer E: Unstable angina is characterized by substernal chest pain occurring at rest or occurring with more severity, longer duration, or increasing frequency. ECG may be normal or show ST depression or T wave inversion, and the troponin level is not elevated. It is caused by incomplete coronary artery occlusion by a thrombus or atherosclerosis, commonly due to a ruptured plaque with subsequent clot formation. This patient's chest pain is exertional, does not occur at rest, and is consistently relieved with rest, and thus would be consistent with stable angina.\n\nBullet Summary:\nStable angina is characterized by exertional chest pain that is not changing in quality or quantity and is relieved with rest.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 72-year-old man with chest pain during physical activity that goes away with rest. His past medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which are all risk factors for coronary artery disease. His medications are amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker for blood pressure), atorvastatin (a statin for cholesterol), and metformin for diabetes.\n\nThe physical exam shows normal vital signs, a regular heart rhythm with no murmurs or other abnormal sounds. The chest isn't tender when pressed, which might rule out musculoskeletal issues like costochondritis. The ECG is shown but we don't have the image, and the troponin is normal (<0.017 ng/mL), which is important because elevated troponin would suggest myocardial damage, like a MI.\n\nThe key points here are the chest pain characteristics. The pain occurs with exertion and resolves with rest. That's classic for angina. The question is whether it's stable or unstable. Stable angina is when the pattern is predictable\u2014same level of exertion causes pain, and it's relieved by rest. Unstable angina is when the pain occurs at rest, is more severe, or occurs more frequently/with less exertion. The patient here says the pain isn't worsening and only happens with activity, so that leans towards stable angina. \n\nNon-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) or STEMI would have different ECG changes and possibly elevated troponin. Since his troponin is normal, that makes MI less likely. Costochondritis usually causes tenderness on palpation, which he doesn't have. So the most likely answer is D, Stable angina.\n</think>\n\nD",

These symptoms and signs in this patient are most consistent with adrenal tuberculosis requiring RIPE therapy (rifamycin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) as well as glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and aldosterone. Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to dysfunction at the level of the adrenal glands themselves, as opposed to upstream factors such as the pituitary gland. Primary adrenal insufficiency in developed nations is most often caused by autoimmune disease. In developing nations, adrenal tuberculosis is a significant cause of primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal tuberculosis often presents with a history of tuberculosis or tuberculosis symptoms, as well as symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and hyperpigmentation. Patients often have hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, low morning cortisol, a failed cosyntropin test, and high ACTH concentrations. Radiography may demonstrate bilateral adrenal calcifications, and/or adrenal enlargement. Tuberculosis can infect all cortices of the adrenal glands bilaterally, and therefore treatment requires eradicating the infection with multi-drug therapy (RIPE therapy) as well as replacement of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, which may be achieved by high-dose hydrocortisone or other combinations of steroids that together provide glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement.\n\nVinnard and Blumberg outline the signs and symptoms, histopathology, lab results, imaging, differential diagnosis, and treatments associated with adrenal tuberculosis. They recommend early recognition and treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bilateral adrenalectomy, prednisone therapy, and fludrocortisone therapy are incorrect because medical therapy should first be attempted to eradicate the infection before undergoing surgery. Bilateral adrenalectomy may be considered if there is suspicion of lung cancer with metastasis to the bilateral adrenal glands. Patients will require lifelong replacement therapy.\n\nAnswer B: Dexamethasone alone is incorrect because this patient likely has tuberculosis and should be treated for it. Additionally, this patient has signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), and patients often require mineralocorticoid therapy or a high dose of a glucocorticoid with mineralocorticoid activity (e.g., hydrocortisone). Dexamethasone has minimal to absent mineralocorticoid activity.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone therapy and immunoglobulin therapy are incorrect because this patient has adrenal tuberculosis. Although autoimmune adrenalitis can cause primary adrenal insufficiency, immunoglobulins are not used to treat this condition.\n\nAnswer D: Prednisone taper would be appropriate for acute conditions such as an asthma or COPD exacerbation. While prednisone will treat the symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency, it will not treat active tuberculosis infection. Primary adrenal insufficiency in developed nations is most often caused by autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison disease) and presents with fatigue, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation, and muscle weakness. In this condition, long-term steroid therapy is indicated.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with adrenal tuberculosis should be treated with rifamycin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, as well as glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement.",

The physical exam shows hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa and temporal muscle wasting. The abdominal radiograph shows bilateral adrenal calcifications. \n\nLooking at the labs: sodium is low (130), potassium is high (5.2), HCO3 is 24, which is normal. The morning cortisol is 2, which is very low. After cosyntropin stimulation, it's 8, still below the normal threshold of 18. The ACTH is elevated at 80 pg/mL (normal is 10-60). \n\nHmm, so the key here is the endocrine findings. High ACTH and low cortisol suggests primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) because in primary, ACTH is high due to the adrenals not responding. In secondary (pituitary issue), ACTH would be low. The cosyntropin test didn't increase cortisol enough, confirming that the adrenals aren't functioning. \n\nNow, the patient has adrenal calcifications on imaging. That's a classic sign of tuberculosis (TB) of the adrenals, especially in someone from a country with high TB prevalence like India. Even though he's been in the US, TB can lie dormant. Also, hyperpigmentation is common in Addison's. The weight loss and chronic cough could be TB-related as well. \n\nThe options are: \n\nA) Bilateral adrenalectomy and steroids. Wait, but adrenalectomy is for Cushing's, not Addison's. Plus, if the adrenals are already destroyed, you wouldn't remove them. So probably not A.\n\nB) Dexamethasone. That's a glucocorticoid, but since he has adrenal insufficiency, he needs replacement. However, dexamethasone doesn't have mineralocorticoid activity, so he'd need fludrocortisone too. But the options here are separate. Option D is prednisone taper, which also lacks mineralocorticoid. So maybe not B.\n\nC) Hydrocortisone",

The other lab values like BUN and creatinine are elevated, suggesting possible dehydration. The physical exam mentions dry mucous membranes and hot flushed skin, which points towards dehydration. The key here is the hypernatremia (high sodium) along with the clinical presentation.\n\nNow, hypernatremia usually indicates dehydration, especially hypertonic dehydration where the body has lost more water than electrolytes.

Dextrose solutions can help because when you infuse dextrose, the body uses the glucose, which then pulls water into the cells, helping to dilute the sodium. But the patient might also need some electrolyte replacement, but maybe not. \n\nOption C is hypotonic saline (like 0.45% NaCl). Hypotonic fluids are used to correct hypernatremia because they add water to the system, which can lower the sodium levels gradually.

This feature where the QRS complexes appear to \u201ctwist\u201d around the isoelectric line is seen in torsades de pointes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: IV lorazepam is the medical treatment for pediatric status epilepticus. Status epilepticus is a seizure that lasts for greater than 5 minutes or recurrent seizures with no return to baseline. This patient has an ECG showing torsades de pointes, which explains his sudden loss of consciousness as well as a normal EEG.\n\nAnswer B: A pacemaker can be used to treat refractory dysrhythmias caused by Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, but would not be the initial step in management for this patient. Beta-blocker medications should be used prior to pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: While potassium and magnesium should be repleted, procainamide is a class 1A anti-arrhythmic medication that prolongs the QT interval. This class of medication is contraindicated in patients with long QT syndrome or torsades de pointes.\n\nAnswer E: Ethosuximide is used to treat absence seizures. The loss of consciousness associated with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome can be mistaken for absence seizures, but the patient's prolonged QT interval on ECG makes Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome the most likely diagnosis. Of note, valproic acid is also a medication for absence seizures.\n\nBullet Summary:\nJervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome should be treated with repletion of potassium and magnesium as well as initiation of beta-blocker medication with pacemaker placement reserved for refractory cases.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 4-year-old boy with worsening seizures. His grandmother mentions he \"drops\" when running, which sounds like absence seizures or maybe atonic seizures. He's been on valproic acid, but it's not working. The recent increase in seizures after daycare enrollment might be stress-related, but the lack of response to voice commands is concerning. The family history of a cousin's sudden death could point to something like Dravet syndrome or another genetic epilepsy with sudden death risk.\n\nThe ECGs: Figure A is unrevealing, but when he's startled (leading to a seizure), Figure B is done. The sudden loss of consciousness after a startle suggests reflex anoxic seizures, but the ECG might show something like a long QT interval, which can cause arrhythmias and seizures. The electrolytes show low potassium (3.4) and magnesium (1.7), which are both low. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can lower the potassium level further and contribute to arrhythmias, especially long QT. The sudden death in the family might be related to an undiagnosed channelopathy like LQTS.\n\nThe options: \n\nA) Lorazepam is for acute seizures, but if the ECG shows a cardiac issue like LQTS, maybe that's part of the problem. But the question is about next step. The electrolyte abnormalities need correction first. \n\nB) Pacemaker for bradycardia? If the ECG showed a heart block, but the pulse is 110, so maybe not. Unless the second ECG (Figure B) shows a severe arrhythmia like torsades de pointes, which is associated with low K and Mg. \n\nC) Replete K and Mg and start a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers are used in LQTS (like propranolol). If the ECG in Figure B shows prolonged QT, then correcting electrolytes and starting a beta-blocker makes sense. \n\nD) Procainamide is a sodium channel blocker, used for arrhythmias but might worsen LQTS. So probably not D. \n\nE) Ethosuximide is for absence seizures. But the seizures here might be atonic or related to cardiac issues. However, the EEG was unrevealing, so maybe not absence. \n\nThe key points: The sudden drop with startle, family history of sudden death, low",

The most appropriate initial management for patients in ADHF is a loop diuretic such as furosemide.\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a condition in which the heart does not pump effectively and can be due to either difficulty with relaxation in diastole or contraction in systole or a combination of both. Risk factors for this condition include myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, valvular disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. Left-sided HF leads to decreased forward flow into the systemic circulation and increased congestion in the pulmonary circulation which clinically manifests as shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, and crackles on lung exam. Early pulmonary edema leads to a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch which causes hypoxia. Hypoxia leads to a compensatory increase in the respiratory rate, which leads to hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis. The most appropriate initial treatment for patients in ADHF is a loop diuretic such as furosemide, which helps alleviate fluid overload. Other treatments for acute exacerbations may include nitroglycerin (in hypertensive patients) and BIPAP.\n\nYancy et al. discuss the most recent ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of heart failure. They review current testing and treatment regimens. Acute episodes may be managed with loop diuretics to reduce volume overload and improve symptoms.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ivabradine inhibits the funny current, an electrical current that leads to spontaneous depolarization in pacemaker cells, leading to decreased heart rate. It reduces the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, it should not be started in ADHF due to lack of mortality benefit and should be held in ADHF patients with severe decompensation due to decreased heart rate leading to decreased cardiac output.\n\nAnswer C: Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that reduces mortality when used in patients with chronic HFrEF. However, beta-blockers can worsen decompensated HFrEF due to negative inotropy and should not be started in ADHF.\n\nAnswer D: Sacubitril and valsartan is a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that improves mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF. ARNIs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be started in ADHF due to concern for hypotension and worsening renal function.

His pulse is 90, which is a bit fast, and his respiratory rate is 30, which is elevated. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air, which is low.

The abdomen is soft and non-tender, so maybe no liver issues contributing here. Neuro exam is normal, so no stroke or neurological cause for his symptoms.\n\nThe ABG results: pH 7.56 (alkalosis), pCO2 25 (low, so respiratory alkalosis?), HCO3 29 (high, so metabolic alkalosis?), but wait, how do these combine? Let me think. The pH is high, so alkalosis. The pCO2 is low (respiratory alkalosis), and HCO3 is elevated (metabolic alkalosis). But the question is, which one is primary?\n\nWait, respiratory alkalosis would lower HCO3, but here HCO3 is high. So maybe the primary process is metabolic alkalosis, and the respiratory system is trying to compensate by hyperventilating (lowering pCO2). But the pH is high, so the two are in the same direction. Alternatively, maybe the patient has a mixed disorder. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see the pO2 is 62, which is low, and SaO2 87%, so hypoxemia.

Symptoms include bulbar muscle weakness and type 2 respiratory failure (inadequate alveolar ventilation). The most appropriate initial step in management is to maintain adequate respiratory function by intubation. Plasmapheresis or IVIG is used to remove acetylcholine receptor antibodies from circulation, and steroids are started for long-term therapy. Avoiding risk factors and pre-medication before procedures with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is important for preventing repeat occurrences.\n\nRodrigues et al. review the evidence regarding the occurrence of myasthenic crisis in patients with COVID. They discuss how treatment with IVIG and plasma exchange were important in the care of these patients. They recommend also considering whether rituximab and tocilizumab may be effective in these cases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine can be used in a cholinergic crisis. A cholinergic crisis is an acute exacerbation of muscle weakness due to over-medication with cholinergic anti-cholinesterases. This disease would present with diarrhea, sweating, miosis, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. It rarely occurs with proper dosing of pyridostigmine.\n\nAnswer B: Edrophonium can be used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor. In a positive test, a patient will exhibit temporary resolution of muscle weakness. In this patient\u2019s case, the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis has already been made and he also had a recent exposure to a pharmaceutical known to precipitate myasthenic crisis.\n\nAnswer C: Neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the management of myasthenia gravis, but it is contraindicated in the initial treatment of myasthenic crisis. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may increase respiratory secretions, which can worsen respiratory failure.\n\nAnswer E: Thymectomy is indicated in refractory cases of myasthenia gravis (and for increased risk of thymoma). In an unstable condition such as myasthenic crisis, thymectomy should be deferred. For patients over the age of 60, thymectomy is controversial.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMyasthenic crisis can be precipitated by infection, surgery, and medications (aminoglycosides and beta-blockers) and should be managed with intubation followed by plasmapheresis or IVIG.",

The key points here are his history of myasthenia gravis and the recent urinary tract infection treated with gentamicin. \n\nFirst, I remember that myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease leading to muscle weakness, especially fatigable. The medications he's on include pyridostigmine, which is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat myasthenia. Now, the problem arises with the gentamicin. Wait, gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, right? And aminoglycosides are known to cause neuromuscular blockade, which can exacerbate myasthenia gravis symptoms. So the combination here is critical. The patient developed a UTI and was given gentamicin, which likely worsened his myasthenia, leading to respiratory failure (as evidenced by the low oxygen saturation, high CO2, and pH 7.30 indicating respiratory acidosis).\n\nThe question is about the next step after intubation. The options are Atropine, Edrophonium, Neostigmine, Plasmapheresis, or Thymectomy. \n\nLet's think. Since he's already on pyridostigmine, which is a cholinesterase inhibitor, but maybe the dose isn't enough, or the gentamicin is blocking the neuromuscular junction further. So, in myasthenic crisis (which this seems like), the first line is to increase the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, the patient is already on pyridostigmine. But maybe he needs more? Neostigmine is another cholinesterase inhibitor. Wait, but edrophonium is used for diagnosis (Tensilon test), but in crisis, they might use neostigmine as treatment. However, in this case, since he's already on pyridostigmine, perhaps the issue is that the drug isn't sufficient, so increasing the dose or giving neostigmine (which is a shorter-acting but maybe more potent option in crisis) could be needed. \n\nAlternatively, plasmapheresis is used in myasthenic crisis when there's a severe exacerbation, especially if there's antibody-mediated block.

The options are about expressive language, fine motor, gross motor, social/receptive language, or normal.\n\nStarting with the expressive language skills (Option A). The child has a vocabulary of 10-25 words and uses them as 1-word commands. At 2 years, typical expressive language should be around 50 words and starting to combine 2 words. So 10-25 words might be below average. Wait, but maybe I should check the exact milestones. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me recall: by 2 years, children usually have about 50 words and can form two-word phrases. So if she's only using 10-25 words and just single words, that's delayed. So that could be abnormal. But the question says she uses 1-word commands. Maybe that's okay? Wait, maybe the number is the key here. 10-25 is way below 50, so that's a problem. So A might be the answer.\n\nFine motor skills (B): She can copy a line. At 2 years, copying a circle is typical, but copying a line might be earlier. Wait, let me think. At 18 months, they can copy a circle, and by 2-3 years, maybe more complex shapes. Wait, actually, copying a line is around 12-15 months, so by 2 years, they can copy a circle. So if she can only copy a line, that might be delayed. Wait, but the question says she can copy a line. Maybe that's okay? Or is that behind? Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Wait, maybe I need to check the milestones again. Let me think: typical fine motor milestones for 2 years include being able to copy a vertical line and a circle. So copying a line (vertical) is expected. So maybe that's normal. So B might not be the issue.\n\nGross motor skills (C): She can walk downstairs with both feet on each step.

He should undergo monofilament testing to assess the subsequent risk of developing foot ulcers.\n\nDiabetic neuropathy is the most common underlying cause of diabetic foot ulcers. The pathophysiology of diabetic foot ulcers is thought to be the loss of pain and pressure sensation, which leads to muscular imbalance and foot deformities. This subsequently decreases microcirculation and impairs the integrity of the skin, leading to the formation of foot ulcers. Diabetic foot ulcers, like other neuropathic ulcers, occur commonly under bony prominences in the foot. During monofilament testing, a 10-g monofilament is placed on the plantar surface of the foot at a right angle, and pressure is applied until the patient can no longer tolerate it or the filament buckles. Patients with diabetic neuropathy have a higher-pressure threshold due to loss of sensation, and this is a useful predictor of the severity of diabetic neuropathy and future foot ulcer formation. The management of diabetic neuropathy consists of tight glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure control, exercise, preventing complications, and pain management with pharmacotherapy (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or gabapentinoid antiseizure medications).\n\nTesfaye et al. study the efficacy of various first-line medications for diabetic nephropathy including amitriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin. The authors found that there were no differences between any of the medications as monotherapy. The authors recommended adding combination pharmacotherapy for patients with painful diabetic neuropathy that do not respond to initial monotherapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ankle-brachial index is a calculation made in the assessment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). While PAD can present with arterial ulcers, these are usually located at the tip of the toes and not the plantar surface. Furthermore, the ankle-brachial index does not accurately assess small vessel disease, which is associated with diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nAnswer B: Capillary refill time, when delayed, may suggest decreased limb perfusion. This is a nonspecific test, as decreased limb perfusion can be caused by peripheral arterial disease, volume depletion, or hypotension.\n\nAnswer C: Contrast-enhanced foot MRI is the most sensitive and specific test to identify soft tissue complications of acute osteomyelitis. This patient has no clinical features of osteomyelitis (fever, chills, or malaise, ulcer that probes to bone) and does not require imaging currently.\n\nAnswer D: Knee reflex testing is not useful in assessing diabetic neuropathy. While diabetic neuropathy can affect large nerve fibers in the lower extremities, it typically impairs ankle reflexes while sparing knee reflexes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPreventative measures for diabetic foot ulcers should focus on regular foot exams with monofilament testing to assess for diabetic neuropathy.",

The question is asking which test will best assess his future risk of foot ulcers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of the options measures. The options are ankle-brachial index, capillary refill time, MRI, knee reflexes, and monofilament testing. \n\nSince he's diabetic, common complications include neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Foot ulcers in diabetics are often due to a combination of neuropathy (loss of sensation leading to unnoticed injuries) and poor blood flow (from PAD, which slows healing). \n\nAnkle-brachial index (ABI) measures the ratio of blood pressure in the ankles to that in the arms. A low ABI indicates PAD, which is a risk factor for ulcers because reduced blood flow impairs healing. \n\nMonofilament testing checks for neuropathy. The 10g monofilament tests protective sensation; if he can't feel it, that's a problem because he might not notice injuries, leading to ulcers. \n\nSo both ABI and monofilament are important. But the question is about assessing future risk. Both are part of the standard assessment for diabetic foot exams. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about future risk. The current ulcer is already present, but they want to assess future risk. So, both neuropathy and vascular status are key. But which test is more directly about risk?\n\nThe options are separate. The question asks which test \"most appropriately\" assesses future risk. \n\nIn clinical guidelines, both sensory testing (monofilament) and ABI are recommended for assessing risk of ulcers. However, the question might be looking for the one that's more directly related to preventing future ulcers by identifying the key risks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is E, monofilament, because loss of sensation is a major risk factor. But ABI is also critical because without adequate blood flow, even a small injury won't heal. \n\nWait, the question is about assessing future risk. So, if the patient has neuropathy (detected by monofilament) and/or PAD (detected by ABI), both contribute to risk. But which test is the best for assessing future risk? \n\nThe options are separate, so perhaps the answer is both A and E.

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin. It can more accurately characterize if a stroke occurred, and the extent of the injury.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe workup of a transient ischemic attack should be centered on a thorough neurological exam, a non-contrast CT scan of the head, and administration of aspirin assuming there is no intracranial bleed.",

The question is about the next step in management. The options are Aspirin, Atorvastatin, CTA head/neck, Labetalol, or MRI brain.\n\nFirst, the CT scan of the head was unremarkable, which is common in TIA because CT might not show acute changes early on. But since the symptoms have resolved, the next steps usually involve imaging to look for possible sources of stroke or TIA. \n\nNow, the options: Aspirin and Atorvastatin are medications. Aspirin is an antiplatelet, which is part of TIA management, but the question is about the next step after initial assessment. The guidelines recommend imaging like CTA or MRI. \n\nCTA (option C) can show vascular abnormalities, like a clot or stenosis. MRI, especially diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), can detect small infarcts that CT might miss. However, in a TIA, if the MRI is negative, then CTA or MRA might be needed. But the question is about the next step. \n\nWait, the patient had a normal CT head. The current guidelines suggest that after a TIA, imaging is important. The CTA head/neck can assess for large vessel disease. Alternatively, MRI might be better for detecting recent ischemic changes. But some protocols might prioritize CTA for vascular imaging. \n\nAlternatively, the ABCD2 score is used to assess TIA risk, but the question is about the next step. The American Heart Association guidelines recommend that patients with TIA should undergo urgent imaging, including brain imaging (like MRI or CT perfusion) and vascular imaging (CTA, MRA, or Cervical Artery Duplex).

A history of both prematurity and respiratory disease makes a patient more at risk for these serious infections, increasing the importance of vaccinations. The regular vaccine schedule recommends the following vaccines at 2 months of age: DTaP (inactivated), HBV (subunit), HiB (inactivated), PCV 13 (inactivated), poliovirus (inactivated), and rotavirus (live-attenuated).

She had NRDS and was in the NICU, but now she's doing well and gaining weight.

The usual vaccines at 2 months include DTaP, Hib, PCV13, polio, HepB, and rotavirus. Hep A isn't typically given at 2 months; that's more like 12-23 months. So option A includes HAV which might not be right.\n\nNow, considering the prematurity. The CDC guidelines say that the vaccination schedule is based on the child's chronological age, not adjusted for prematurity. So even though she was born early, she should still get her vaccines on time. The history of NRDS might make the parents worried, but unless there's a current medical issue (like an acute illness), vaccines shouldn't be delayed. \n\nLooking at the options: option D and E suggest delaying all vaccines for 2 months.

It is the most common cause of dementia and its risk factors include increasing age, female gender, family history, and trisomy 21 (due to the amyloid precursor protein found on chromosome 21). This is a clinical diagnosis based on cognitive testing (such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment or the mini-mental status exam) and ruling out other causes of dementia (vitamin B12 deficiency, depression, or hypothyroidism).\n\nWeller et al. review the current understanding of Alzheimer dementia pathophysiology. They discuss recent advances in clinical evaluation and treatment. They recommend having a high index of suspicion for the disease in elderly patients who appear to be regressing in their ability to take care of themselves.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a prion protein that is fatal, leading to death usually within 1 year of illness onset. Dementia progresses rapidly in this disease and is sometimes associated with startle myoclonus.\n\nAnswer C: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized primarily by disinhibition, apathy, or aphasia as a result of atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. It tends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimer dementia. Behavioral changes are often the first noticeable symptom in FTD while they tend to occur later in Alzheimer disease progression.

The MoCA is a cognitive test, and a score below 26 might indicate dementia.

Symptoms include memory loss, especially short-term, difficulty with language, and behavioral changes like irritability. Wandering and getting lost can occur in later stages. The progression over years fits Alzheimer's, which is a slowly progressing disease.\n\nB) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD): This is a prion disease with rapid progression, often over weeks to months, leading to rapidly worsening dementia, myoclonus, and other neurological symptoms. The question mentions the symptoms have developed over years, so CJD is less likely.\n\nC) Frontotemporal dementia: This typically presents with changes in behavior and personality, language difficulties, and is more common in younger individuals (like 40s-60s). The primary symptoms here are memory issues and wandering, which are more typical of Alzheimer's. Frontotemporal might have more pronounced social disinhibition or language problems, but the timeline and presentation here might not fit as well.\n\nD) Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH): Classic symptoms are the triad of gait disturbance (wide-based, magnetic gait), urinary incontinence, and dementia.

She's sexually active with condom use. No abdominal or pelvic pain, but some mild dysuria. Vital signs are all normal except maybe the low temp, but that's within normal range. On exam, there's a thick white discharge from the cervix, no tenderness or masses. Also some whitish urethral discharge. Negative pregnancy test.\n\nHmm, the key here is to figure out what infection she has. The symptoms include vaginal discharge, dysuria, and cervical discharge. The discharge is foul-smelling, which makes me think of bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis. But the cervical discharge and urethral discharge might point more towards a sexually transmitted infection (STI) like chlamydia or gonorrhea. \n\nWait, the discharge is thick and white. BV usually has a thin, fishy-smelling discharge. Thick white discharge could be candidiasis (yeast infection), but the foul smell doesn't fit that. Trichomoniasis is usually frothy and yellow-green, but maybe the description here is a bit different. The presence of urethral discharge suggests involvement beyond just the vagina, possibly affecting the urethra, which is common in gonorrhea or chlamydia. \n\nThe absence of pelvic pain or tenderness might make PID less likely, but we can't rule it out entirely. Since she's sexually active, even with condoms, STIs are a consideration. The question is, what's the most appropriate treatment?\n\nThe options are antibiotics. Let's think about the guidelines. For uncomplicated STIs, the current recommendations are:\n\n- For gonorrhea and chlamydia (which are often co-infected), the treatment is ceftriaxone (for gonorrhea) plus azithromycin (for chlamydia). That's option C. \n\nAlternatively, if it's BV, metronidazole (E) would be the choice. But BV is more likely to have a thin discharge and fishy odor without the urethral involvement. The presence of urethral discharge and cervical exudate points more towards gonorrhea or chlamydia. \n\nThe patient has dysuria, which can occur with UTI, but the discharge from the urethra suggests an STI.",

Classic symptoms include pruritus after hot baths as well as swelling, burning pain, and rubor of the hands and feet (erythromelalgia). Patients may also have gout due to increased cell turnover leading to hyperuricemia. Older patients (> 60 years old) and those with prior thrombosis should be treated with a myelosuppressive agent, most commonly hydroxyurea with or without aspirin. Therapeutic phlebotomy is often indicated on these patients.\n\nStuart and Viera review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera.

This treatment represents a symptomatic treatment versus an agent that addresses the underlying cause.\n\nAnswer C: Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is used to reduce uric acid levels in the management of chronic gout. Gout would present with acute severe joint pain (typically the great toe) with risk factors of alcohol use, obesity, and thiazide use. It is not used in the acute management of gout or in polycythemia vera.\n\nAnswer E: Prednisone is a glucocorticoid that is used in many different clinical situations but is not used in the management of polycythemia vera.

The question is asking about the next step in management for that finding.\n\nFirst, let's look at her symptoms. She has sweat stains that are itchy and cause a burning sensation. The sweat stains getting itchy and burning suggests a possible skin condition. The options given are antifungals (fluconazole, nystatin), a topical steroid (clobetasol), an immunomodulator (imiquimod), and prednisone (a systemic steroid).\n\nThe key here is the location: under the breasts. In obese individuals, areas where skin folds occur (like under the breasts, in the groin, etc.) are prone to intertrigo. Intertrigo is a rash caused by skin rubbing against skin, leading to maceration and often secondary infections. The most common infections in such cases are fungal, like candida, or bacterial. \n\nThe symptoms of itching and burning are classic for a fungal infection. The options A and E are antifungals. Fluconazole is oral, nystatin is topical. But wait, the question mentions the finding in Figure A. Since I can't see the figure, I have to rely on the description. If the rash is in a skin fold, topical antifungals are first-line. Nystatin is more for oral or mucocutaneous candidiasis, but maybe the area is more likely to be tinea (ringworm) or candidal intertrigo. However, topical clotrimazole or miconazole are more common, but the options here are fluconazole (oral) or nystatin (topical). Alternatively, maybe it's a bacterial infection, but the burning and itching are more fungal.\n\nAlternatively, could it be something else? The options also include topical steroids (clobetasol). If the rash is due to eczema or another inflammatory condition, steroids might help, but the presence of burning and itching with skin maceration makes me think fungal is more likely. \n\nWait, the patient has moist areas, which is a setup for fungal overgrowth.

The majority of cases of cephalohematoma self-resolve, thus the most appropriate next step in management is observation.\n\nA cephalohematoma is a relatively common traumatic birth injury that occurs after prolonged labor or instrumentation due to rupture of the periosteal bridging veins. Because bleeding through these veins is slow, they typically present several hours after birth with a fluctuant swelling of the scalp that is limited by suture lines. The majority of cases self-resolve between 2 weeks to 3 months. In rare cases, the sequestration of blood in the cephalohematoma may cause an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that requires phototherapy but this is a rare complication. Treatment is with reassurance and outpatient monitoring.\n\nRaines et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cephalohematoma. They discuss how this injury presents gradually and does not cross suture lines. They recommend conservative treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: An incision and drainage procedure is contraindicated in cephalohematoma without signs of infection, such as erythema of the skin overlying the swelling. In cases where the cephalohematoma is thought to be secondarily infected, patients should undergo incision and drainage to prevent osteomyelitis. Patients would present with increasing pain, erythema, and systemic findings such as fever.\n\nAnswer B: Intensive phototherapy may be used to manage the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that may occur due to cephalohematoma, but the majority of cases resolve spontaneously. The unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia found in this patient does not necessitate phototherapy. Unconjugated bilirubin is produced due to the metabolism of hemoglobin.\n\nAnswer C: Neurosurgical decompression may be necessary to manage other neonatal birth injuries, such as intracranial hemorrhages. Because a cephalohematoma involves bleeding between the periosteum and skull (i.e., outside of the skull), it does not require neurosurgical intervention. Intracranial hemorrhages would present with asymmetric reflexes or obtundation.\n\nAnswer E: Red blood cell transfusions are sometimes necessary to manage intracranial hemorrhages in neonates with significant blood loss. They are not usually required to manage cephalohematoma as the bleeding in this condition is limited by the suture lines.

The delivery was vacuum-assisted because of prolonged labor. The baby's stats are mostly normal except for the lump. The lab results show a total bilirubin of 5.5, which is a bit elevated but not super high.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the lump could be. The question mentions it's a fluctuant swelling over the right parietal bone, doesn't cross the midline, and no discoloration. Fluctuant suggests it's a fluid-filled area, maybe a cephalohematoma? Because that's common after vacuum delivery. Cephalohematomas are collections of blood under the periosteum, usually from birth trauma. They are fluctuant, don't cross suture lines (so not crossing midline makes sense here), and the overlying skin isn't discolored initially. \n\nThe options are: incision and drainage, phototherapy, neurosurgical decompression, observation, or RBC transfusion. \n\nCephalohematomas typically don't require intervention. They are usually left to resolve on their own over weeks or months. The main thing is to make sure it's not an infection (like a abscess) but the question says no discoloration, which might argue against that. Also, the mother is worried about infection, but the physical exam doesn't show signs like redness or warmth. So maybe the lump is just a cephalohematoma from the vacuum use during delivery. \n\nThe bilirubin levels: total is 5.5. Newborns can get jaundice, and cephalhematomas can sometimes contribute to higher bilirubin because of the breakdown of blood. But 5.5 mg/dL at 6 hours is a bit early for physiologic jaundice, which usually peaks around day 2-3. However, maybe the hematoma is causing some breakdown. But the direct bilirubin is 0.7, so mostly indirect. \n\nBut the question is about the next step for the lump. Since it's a cephalohematoma, the management is observation. Incision and drainage is for abscesses, which this doesn't seem to be. Phototherapy is for hyperbilirubinemia, but",

        "reason": "This patient has an extensive splenic injury and hemodynamic instability requiring splenectomy, as evidenced by trauma to the left posterior ribs and left flank, low blood pressures with reflex tachycardia, and evidence of splenic rupture and hemoperitoneum on computed tomography imaging. Subsequently, this asplenic patient will require vaccination against encapsulated bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae.\n\nThe capsules of encapsulated bacteria serve as an antiphagocytic virulence factor. To clear these bacteria, opsonization and subsequent clearance by the spleen must occur. In the setting of asplenia, opsonization capability is significantly decreased and thus asplenic patients are at high risk of severe infections by encapsulated bacteria. As such, asplenic patients require vaccination against the encapsulated bacteria S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenza.\n\nPatton et al. review recommendations for serogroup B meningococcal vaccination. The authors find that for patients aged 10 to 25 years old who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease (asplenic patients); 3 doses of the MenB-FHbp vaccine should be given. The authors recommend the administration of only 2 doses of the vaccine to patients that are not at elevated risk.\n\nFigure/Illustration A depicts a traumatic splenic rupture with perisplenic hemoperitoneum (red circle).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Insertion of a nasogastric tube would be appropriate in a patient with bowel obstruction or significant post-operative ileus. There is no evidence that this patient is experiencing obstruction or ileus, which typically presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, and lack of flatus or bowel movements.\n\nAnswer B: Insertion of a thoracostomy tube is not indicated in this patient as there is no evidence of pneumothorax or hemothorax. Patients with pneumothorax or hemothorax typically present with tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. On exam, such patients may have decreased breath sounds. Ultrasonography may also reveal the absence of lung sliding.\n\nAnswer C: Prophylactic intravenous antibiotics are not indicated in the immediate post-operative period for asplenic adults. However, daily oral antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in asplenic patients with a history of another concurrent immunocompromising condition or a history of severe infection due to an encapsulated organism.\n\nAnswer D: Tetanus vaccination is indicated every 10 years in patients who have previously received 3 doses of the tetanus vaccine and have clean or minor wounds. In patients with more extensive wounds who have previously received 3 doses of tetanus vaccine, re-vaccination is only necessary if their last tetanus vaccine was 5 or more years ago. This patient has extensive abrasions but is up to date on all vaccines and last received a tetanus vaccine 3 years ago, so a re-vaccination during this time is not indicated.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAsplenic patients are at increased risk of severe infection by encapsulated bacteria; thus patients that undergo splenic removal require vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae within 14 days of the procedure.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 24-year-old motorcyclist who had a head-on collision. She has a grade V splenic injury, which is the most severe type (since grades go from I to V). The question is about the next step after surgery.\n\nFirst, let's recall the management of splenic injuries. A grade V injury usually requires splenectomy because the spleen is completely shattered or there's no viable tissue left. After surgery, what's next?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Nasogastric tube: Maybe for gastric decompression, but not sure if that's the priority here. Post-op, maybe, but not sure if it's the most important next step.\n\nB) Thoracostomy tube: The physical exam shows ecchymoses and abrasions on the left posterior ribs and flank. Could there be a pneumothorax or hemothorax? But the question mentions the CT abdomen was done, and the main issue is the splenic injury. Unless the CT showed a need for a chest tube, but the question doesn't specify. Maybe not the top priority here.\n\nC) Prophylactic IV antibiotics: Splenic injury, especially after splenectomy, leads to asplenia. Patients are at risk for overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI), which is a severe sepsis. Prophylactic antibiotics might be given, but also vaccinations are crucial. Wait, the question says the last tetanus was 3 years ago. Tetanus is given for wounds, but maybe that's D. But the main thing after splenectomy is preventing infections like from encapsulated bacteria. The options E includes vaccines against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and H. influenzae, which are the vaccines recommended for asplenic patients. However, the question is about the \"most appropriate next step\". \n\nWait, the options are after surgical intervention. So, the immediate next steps: antibiotics? The guidelines for splenectomy in trauma might include prophylactic antibiotics. But also, the vaccines. However, the timing of vaccines: usually, vaccines are given before splenectomy if possible, but if not, they should be given as soon as possible post-op. But maybe the immediate step is antibiotics. Alternatively, the question might be pointing towards the vaccines in E. But let me think again.\n\nThe patient's last tetanus was 3 years ago. The wound is from trauma, so",

The teacher applied dressings and pressure to the patient's injured digit and immediately transported the patient to the emergency department. He arrived within 20 minutes of the accident. The patient has a medical history of asthma and his only medication is albuterol. His temperature is 98.0\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 17/min. Exam was significant for pulsatile bleeding from a clean-cut wound on his right second finger. Radiography of the hand revealed a complete amputation of the right finger from the distal interphalangeal joint. The wound was cleaned, compression applied, analgesics administered, and the hand surgeons were notified. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but the principal would be transporting it to the hospital. Which of the following is the correct method for transporting the amputated finger?",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a fingertip amputation with loss of pulp, nail, and bone (with a possibility for surgical reattachment and repair, efforts should be made to recover the severed tissue). The correct way to transport an amputated digit is to rinse the finger in normal saline to remove gross contaminants, wrap the appendage in gauze moistened by normal saline, place it in a plastic bag, and then place the bag in ice water.\n\nAmputation injuries are common with finger and thumb amputations being the most common. With rapid and proper transport of the patient and appendage, successful reattachment could be possible pending a surgical evaluation. It is important to know how to appropriately package the severed digit so as to optimize tissue viability. Cooling with ice water can slow the metabolic rate of the tissue and result in less tissue damage; however, there is a delicate balance. There must be proper barriers between the digit and ice water to avoid ice burns which could compromise the tissue. Patients should be given IV antibiotics to prevent infection as well.\n\nZhang et al. note that once a finger amputation has occurred, ischemic tolerance times are 12 hours if warm and up to 24 hours if cold. For more proximal amputations, these times are halved due to the presence of muscle tissue, which can undergo irreversible changes after 6 hours of ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Rinsing the amputated finger with hydrogen peroxide could damage the tissue decreasing the chances of salvageability. Avoiding the use of caustic solutions with amputated appendages preserves tissue.\n\nAnswer C: Submerging the finger in ice water could lead to irreversible tissue damage and swelling making reattachment impossible.\n\nAnswer D: Wrapping the finger in moist gauze and then placing in a plastic bag is not enough to optimize a severed finger for transport. Cooling further with ice water is necessary in order to slow down tissue metabolism and prevent further ischemic damage.\n\nAnswer E: Wrapping the finger in moist gauze and placing it directly on ice could damage the finger by direct contact with ice rendering the amputated part non-viable.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe correct handling of an amputated appendage is to first rinse it off with normal saline to remove any gross debris, wrap it in normal saline soaked gauze, put it in a plastic bag, and then place that bag in ice water.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, so the question is about the correct way to transport an amputated finger. Let me think through this step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old who had part of his finger sawed off. The teacher has the amputated finger and the principal is bringing it to the hospital. The options are different methods of transporting it.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with amputated body parts, the goal is to preserve them properly so they can possibly be reattached. The key points I've learned before are that the part should be kept clean and cool but not submerged in liquid. Also, you don't want to let it come into direct contact with ice because that can cause frostbite damage.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A says to rinse with normal saline, wrap in moist gauze, put in a plastic bag, and place the bag in ice water. That sounds familiar. Rinsing with saline would clean it gently without using something harsh like hydrogen peroxide, which might be bad because peroxide can damage tissues. Then wrapping in moist gauze keeps it from drying out. Putting it in a plastic bag and then in ice water... Wait, but isn't the standard method to keep it in a cool environment but not submerged? Maybe the plastic bag with the moist gauze and then surrounded by ice, not submerged in water. Hmm, maybe I need to recall the exact protocol.\n\nOption B uses hydrogen peroxide, which I think is a no-no because it can harm the tissue, making reattachment harder. So B is probably wrong.\n\nOption C says submerge in ice water. That's definitely not right because submerging in liquid, even ice water, can damage the tissues. So C is out.\n\nOption D is wrap in moist gauze and put in a plastic bag. But where is the cooling? Without cooling, the tissue might not last as long. So maybe D is missing the cold part.\n\nOption E is wrap in moist gauze and place on ice. That's better, but maybe the plastic bag is needed to prevent direct contact with the ice. Because if you just put it on ice, the ice could freeze the tissue. So the correct method is to wrap it in moist gauze, place in a water-tight bag, and then surround with ice. So that would be like option A, but wait, option A says to put the bag in ice water. Wait, maybe the standard is to not submerge",

        "reason": "This patient with a medical history of hypertension on blood thinners (apixaban) is presenting with rapidly progressive neurologic symptoms. Initially, his symptoms are in his right upper extremity, which then progresses to affect his speech and cause altered mental status, obtundation, and seizures, which is suggestive of a left-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage.\n\nIntraparenchymal (IPH) cerebral hemorrhages often present with sudden-onset focal neurologic deficits. A unique feature is that IPHs tend to present with progressive/worsening symptoms in contrast to ischemic strokes which often demonstrate stable or improving symptoms. It is not uncommon for a patient to present with focal neurologic deficits, which then progress to seizures and obtundation. Risk factors include older age, hypertension, and blood thinners. The prognosis is poor in intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and outcomes are dependent on the size and location of the bleed. Initial workup should be centered on obtaining a fingerstick blood glucose, securing the airway, and obtaining CNS imaging (often with a non-contrast CT scan). Further management is centered on elevating the head of the bed, reversing the patient's anticoagulation status, and possible neurosurgical intervention (though prognosis is very poor in general).\n\nGross et al. review IPH. They note that IPH has very high morbidity and mortality even when treated. There is ongoing research into minimally invasive approaches for evacuation of primary IPH to optimize and improve outcomes, although immediate medical therapy is needed to reduce mortality which is recommended.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Epidural hematomas present after trauma with the \"talk and die\" syndrome beginning with a period of unconsciousness, a lucid interval, and then progressive obtundation. A CT of the head would demonstrate a lens-shaped lesion, and a burr hole to drain the collection of blood is the treatment of choice. Acute epidural hematomas do not typically begin spontaneously.\n\nAnswer C: Ischemic strokes present with sudden onset, focal neurologic deficits. Generally, after the initial ischemic event, patients will be stable or even note an improvement in their symptoms. It is less likely that this patient's progressive symptoms and seizures are caused by an ischemic stroke when compared to a hemorrhagic stroke or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. This diagnosis is certainly possible, and further workup with CT imaging and possibly MRI is needed to clarify the diagnosis and direct further care.\n\nAnswer D: Subarachnoid hemorrhages generally present with a \"thunderclap\" headache with meningeal signs. It is possible that patients may present with obtundation and confusion with severe subarachnoid hemorrhages. Seizures are uncommon in subarachnoid hemorrhages and generally do not present with such focal neurologic deficits. CT will show blood in the subarachnoid space. The diagnosis can be supported with CTA or a lumbar puncture. Further management may involve nimodipine, neurosurgical intervention, and observation if the bleed is small and has stopped on its own.\n\nAnswer E: Subdural hematomas are more common in the elderly patients and patients with alcohol use disorder and present after trauma with a gradual progression of altered mental status to obtundation. Note that large subdural hematomas may present with a rapid progression of symptoms. CT of the head will demonstrate a crescent-shaped lesion that crosses suture lines. Management may involve neurosurgical evacuation with large subdural hematomas causing mass effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIntraparenchymal hemorrhages may occur spontaneously in the setting of hypertension and blood thinners and present with progressive neurologic deficits that get worse over time with possible seizures.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 77-year-old man with sudden right-sided weakness and speech difficulty, which makes me think of a stroke. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is a common risk factor for ischemic stroke because of emboli. But then his condition rapidly worsened: he's not responding to verbal stimuli, withdraws to pain only on the left side, and then has a seizure and agonal breathing. The blood glucose is normal, so hypoglycemia is unlikely.\n\nHmm, the options are between the different types of hemorrhages and ischemic stroke. Let's think about the presentations. Epidural hematoma often comes after head trauma, which isn't mentioned here. Subdural hematoma can occur with minor trauma, especially in the elderly, but again, no trauma history. Subarachnoid hemorrhage usually presents with a thunderclap headache, which isn't noted here. \n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage (option B) can present with sudden neurological deficits, increased blood pressure (like his 170/100), and rapid deterioration. The fact that he had a seizure might point towards a hemorrhage because bleeding in the brain can cause seizures. Also, the progression to unresponsiveness and agonal breathing suggests a large mass effect from bleeding. \n\nIschemic stroke (option C) typically doesn't cause seizures as often, unless there's a large territory infarct. But the rapid neurological decline and the presence of atrial fibrillation (which is a source of emboli) would make ischemic stroke a possibility. However, the seizure and the very high blood pressure might be more in line with hemorrhage. \n\nWait, the patient is on apixaban, which is an anticoagulant. That increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Since he's on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, a hemorrhagic stroke could be more likely here. The sudden onset, rapid deterioration, high BP, and development of seizures and agonal breathing all point towards a hemorrhage. So between B and D. But subarachnoid hemorrhage usually has different symptoms like severe headache. \n\nSo the most likely is intracerebral hemorrhage (B). The atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, but the meds he's on (apixaban) would be to prevent that. However, if he had a bleed despite being on",

The classic risk factors for this disease can be remembered as \"fat, female, fertile and forty\". Symptoms of acute cholecystitis are right upper quadrant pain that relapses and remits over time. Lab values will show elevated AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin which are also seen in patients where a stone is impacted in the common bile duct. A right upper quadrant ultrasound and MRCP can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

The MRCP with secretin might have tested that, but the question says the ducts are patent. Wait, secretin stimulates gallbladder contraction.

Arsenic inhibits enzymes requiring lipoic acid as a cofactor; thus, it disrupts ATP production and causes oxidative stress. Signs and symptoms of arsenic poisoning include Mees lines (white horizontal/parallel lines on the nail beds), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, hypotension, tachycardia, and a garlic odor on the breath. Severe complications are more common with acute exposures and can include shock, pulmonary edema, rhabdomyolysis, and death. Findings consistent with chronic poisoning include anemia, neuropathy, ataxia, and somnolence. A urine arsenic level can support the diagnosis. The treatment of arsenic poisoning is chelating agents such as dimercaprol and supportive therapy. Dimercaprol is a nephrotoxic chelating agent with a narrow therapeutic index and should be used with care.\n\nMoon et al. study the association between low and moderate arsenic exposure and cardiovascular disease. The authors find that even low-dose exposure to arsenic increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and stroke mortality.

Patients should have a 4-hour acetaminophen level drawn. If it falls above the treatment line on the Rummack Matthew nomogram, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be started. Acetaminophen can cause fulminant liver failure and markedly elevated liver enzymes.\n\nAnswer C: Cyanide inhibits complex IV in the electron transport chain. It can present after exposure to industrial fires. Patients may present with altered mental status and a profound lactic acidosis that does not respond to oxygen administration with rapid progression to death. The treatment involves the administration of hydroxocobalamin which combines with cyanide to form the non-toxic compound cyanocobalamin.\n\nAnswer D: Iron overdose presents with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (bloody), hemorrhagic gastritis, and lactic acidosis.

His wife mentions he's had diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for a week. His history includes depression and suicide attempts, and he's on fluoxetine. He also takes OTC pain meds for a muscle strain. His job is in a semiconductor plant, and he's into homebrewing beer. Vital signs are mostly normal except for tachycardia and slightly elevated pulse.\n\nFirst, the symptoms: altered mental status, GI issues (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), and a garlic odor on his breath. The physical exam shows confusion and the finding in Figure A, which I can't see, but the garlic breath is a big clue. The job in a semiconductor plant might expose him to certain chemicals. Also, making his own beer could involve some substances, but maybe not directly toxic here.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Acetaminophen overdose typically causes liver failure, which might present with confusion, but the GI symptoms could be there. However, the garlic odor isn't a sign of acetaminophen toxicity. Acetaminophen overdose might lead to jaundice, coagulopathy, etc., but the key here is the odor.\n\nB) Arsenic poisoning. Classic symptoms include garlic odor on breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea. Arsenic exposure can happen through contaminated water, pesticides, or industrial exposure. Since he works in a semiconductor plant, arsenic is sometimes used in electronics manufacturing. That fits with his occupation. The chronic exposure over days to weeks could lead to these symptoms.\n\nC) Cyanide poisoning usually presents more acutely with rapid onset of symptoms like confusion, tachycardia, tachypnea, and maybe a bitter almond odor on breath (though not everyone can smell it). The timeline here is more gradual, so maybe less likely. Also, the abdominal symptoms are more prominent in arsenic.\n\nD) Iron overdose causes GI symptoms (like vomiting, diarrhea), and can lead to metabolic acidosis, but the garlic odor isn't associated. Plus, iron toxicity is more common in kids accidentally ingesting pills, but he's an adult. Though he takes OTC meds, maybe not iron specifically unless he's taking supplements, but the question mentions pain meds, so maybe NSAIDs like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.",

        "reason": "Based on the presence of both hemoglobin (Hb) A and S on gel electrophoresis, this patient has sickle cell trait. Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data. The authors found that sickle cell trait is associated with increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy. The authors recommend further evaluation of these associations using prospective studies derived from clinical data.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows gel electrophoresis with an example of a normal (95-98% HbA and < 2% HbF), sickle cell trait (50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF), and sickle cell anemia (85-95% HbS and 5-15% HbF) patient from left to right.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diabetes has not been associated with sickle cell trait in the majority of studies.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is a complication of sickle cell anemia. Mechanisms include functional asplenism, reduced tissue perfusion during a sickle crisis, and chronic transfusions with an indwelling catheter. Common infections include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitis. Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism. Most individuals with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic by age 2 to 4. The spleen subsequently cannot phagocytose encapsulated organisms properly, which predisposes sickle cell patients to infection.\n\nAnswer E: Stroke is a complication of sickle cell anemia but not sickle cell trait. This is due to the increased viscosity of the blood and reduced deformability of red cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSickle cell trait is associated with episodes of painless hematuria.",

His uncle died from sickle cell anemia, and both parents are carriers of the sickle cell gene. That makes the child at high risk for sickle cell disease since both parents are carriers (homozygous for the sickle cell gene would result in the disease).\n\nThe question is about the most likely future complication. The options are diabetes, hematuria, infection, splenectomy, or stroke. \n\nSickle cell disease complications include things like infections, because the sickling can damage the spleen (leading to splenic sequestration and increased infection risk), strokes (due to vessel blockage), acute chest syndrome, and other issues. Splenectomy might be a treatment for some complications, but it's not a complication itself. Hematuria isn't a primary complication I recall. Diabetes might be a long-term issue but not the most common. \n\nThe key here is the most likely complication. Infections are a major issue in sickle cell, especially in young children because of asplenia. However, stroke is also a significant complication, particularly in children. The timing here is important. The child is 6 weeks old, so maybe the risk of stroke is a bit later, but the question is about future complications. \n\nWait, the parents are both carriers, so the child has a 25% chance of having sickle cell disease. Since the screening was abnormal, he likely has it. The options given: the most common complications include infections (due to functional asplenia), acute chest syndrome, pain crises, and stroke. Strokes can occur in children with sickle cell, often as a result of occlusion in the basal ganglia or other areas. \n\nThe answer might be stroke (E) or infection (C). But which is more likely? The question is asking for the \"most likely\" complication. Infections are very common, especially in the first few years. However, the options also include splenectomy. Wait, but splenectomy is a treatment for splenic sequestration or chronic issues, but the complication would be the infection risk from asplenia. \n\nAlternatively, stroke is a major complication, but maybe less common than infections.

Melatonin levels naturally decrease as patients age.\n\nNormal aging shortens most phases of sleep. It is normal for melatonin levels to decline during normal aging; however, this change is not responsible for all the symptoms associated with declining quality of sleep. Other changes that occur include decreased REM sleep, decreased stage N3 sleep, and a compensatory increase in stage N2 sleep. Patients will often complain of sleep that is less refreshing than it was in their youth, yet they are still functional and not excessively tired. Treatment is with sleep hygiene though some patients will also benefit from treatment with melatonin supplementation.\n\nCardinali reviews the role of melatonin in aging. He discusses how natural levels of melatonin decrease in aging animals, which may have implications on the circadian clock. He recommends studies on whether melatonin supplementation may be beneficial to mitigate the effects of aging.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Decreased orexin levels would be seen in patients with narcolepsy, which presents with sudden episodes of falling asleep. This tends to occur in younger patients and is also associated with cataplexy or sudden loss in muscle tone. Treatment of this disorder is with stimulant medications such as modafinil.\n\nAnswer C: Increased acetylcholine levels would not be seen in patients as they age and would not explain the changes this patient is experiencing. Rather, acetylcholine levels tend to decline as we age. Drinking caffeinated drinks is associated with increased acetylcholine levels in the brain.\n\nAnswer D: Increased dopamine would not be a principle change seen in age-related sleep changes. Higher dopamine levels would increase feelings of being awake as well as alertness. In contrast, decreased dopamine levels can be seen in patients with Parkinson disease, which would present with bradykinesia and a resting tremor.\n\nAnswer E: Increased norepinephrine would result in increased wakefulness and potentially insomnia; however, it would not explain the changes seen in normal aging. This chemical is naturally produced during the fight or flight response and can be artificially increased by stimulant drugs such as cocaine.\n\nBullet Summary:\nNormal aging results in a shortening of most phases of sleep as well as decreased melatonin levels and presents with sleep that is subjectively less restful.",

The patient is a 69-year-old man who's generally healthy but reports feeling less well-rested despite sleeping 7 hours a night compared to 9 in his youth. His wife says he sleeps peacefully, and he doesn't feel fatigued now. The question is about physiological changes related to his age affecting sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to recall age-related changes in sleep patterns. As people age, their sleep architecture changes. They tend to have less slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) and REM sleep. Also, the total sleep time decreases, so needing less sleep as one ages is normal. But why does he feel less rested even with 7 hours?\n\nMelatonin, which regulates sleep-wake cycles, decreases with age. Lower melatonin might lead to difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, but the patient's wife says he sleeps peacefully. So maybe that's not the main issue here. \n\nOrexin (hypocretin) is involved in wakefulness. Decreased orexin could lead to excessive sleepiness, but the patient isn't reporting fatigue. Plus, narcolepsy is linked to low orexin, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nAcetylcholine is involved in REM sleep. If there's increased acetylcholine, maybe more REM? But older adults have less REM. Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe the decrease in REM is due to other factors. Not sure if this is the right path.\n\nDopamine and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters involved in alertness. Increased levels might make it harder to fall asleep, but the patient is sleeping. Alternatively, maybe the quality of sleep is worse due to less deep sleep, but the question is about physiological changes. \n\nWait, the key point here is that as people age, they often require less sleep. The fact that he now sleeps 7 hours and feels less rested than when he slept 9 might be due to the sleep being less efficient. The physiological change related to aging that affects sleep quality could be decreased melatonin. But the options include decreased melatonin (A). However, the question is about the change that would be seen, not the cause of his feeling. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the decrease in slow-wave sleep is due to decreased growth hormone or other factors, but those aren't listed here.

As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient\u2019s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.",

He's having trouble walking and vomiting. His vital signs are all normal except for the ataxic gait and rightward nystagmus. The Dix-Hallpike didn't change his symptoms, and the head impulse test showed corrective saccades without skew deviation.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the type of dizziness (vertigo, since it's spinning), the nystagmus direction, and the test results. The Dix-Hallpike is used for BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo), but since his symptoms didn't change with that maneuver, it might not be BPPV. The head impulse test with corrective saccades suggests a vestibular hypofunction, maybe from something like vestibular neuritis. Nystagmus direction: rightward nystagmus could indicate a problem in the left vestibular system, but I need to think about that again. \n\nThe options are CT, Epley (for BPPV), MRI, prednisone, or tPA. Since the Dix-Hallpike didn't help, BPPV is less likely, so Epley might not be the next step. The head impulse test findings point more towards a central or peripheral vestibular issue. The patient is young with no history, so stroke (which would need CT or MRI) is possible but less likely? But the symptoms are acute. Wait, the nystagmus is constant, which is more concerning for a central cause, like a cerebellar or brainstem issue. \n\nVestibular neuritis usually presents with acute vertigo, nystagmus that's horizontal or vertical, and the head impulse test abnormality. But if the nystagmus is constant and not positional, maybe it's a central lesion. The ataxic gait also points to a central issue, like a cerebellar stroke or multiple sclerosis. Since the patient is young, maybe a demyelinating disease? Or a vestibular migraine? But the nystagmus and ataxia are more concerning. \n\nThe next step would be to rule out a structural lesion. CT is quick for hemorrhage or mass, but MRI would be better for ischemic stroke or other lesions. Since it's the emergency department, maybe CT first? But MRI is more sensitive for certain issues",

Symptoms include watery or mucoid discharge and eye swelling. The conjunctiva may be especially irritated. Diagnosis can be established by direct antibody testing or PCR. Treatment for chlamydial conjunctivitis includes both topical and oral erythromycin as there is likely dissemination of the infection. The most common complication of chlamydial conjunctivitis is pneumonia. Of note, all neonates with gonococcal conjunctivitis should also be treated for chlamydia.\n\nSmith-Norowitz et al. studied whether antibiotic prophylaxis was beneficial compared with silver nitrate for chlamydia conjunctivitis.

They recommend testing infants for the disease if it is suspected so that oral antibiotics can be administered effectively.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Artificial tears can be used in chemical conjunctivitis. The most common cause of neonatal chemical conjunctivitis is post-delivery silver nitrate drops. It usually presents within the first 24 hours following birth/exposure with mild conjunctival injection and tearing, and will spontaneously resolve within 2-4 days.\n\nAnswer B: Intravenous acyclovir is used to treat conjunctivitis caused by herpes simplex virus.

The vital signs are a bit elevated, but not critically. The eyes have mucoid discharge and swollen lids, but fluorescein test is negative, so no corneal abrasion. Lung exam shows crackles and chest X-ray with hyperinflation and bilateral infiltrates.\n\nFirst, the eye symptoms. Newborns with eye issues, especially with discharge, make me think of conjunctivitis. The standard prophylaxis after birth is silver nitrate or erythromycin to prevent gonococcal or chlamydial infections. Since the mother had limited prenatal care, maybe she wasn't screened for STDs. The baby got silver nitrate, but maybe that wasn't enough or the strain is resistant?\n\nThe options for eye treatment include topical antibiotics like erythromycin (E) or artificial tears (A). But the question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy considering the systemic symptoms. The baby also has respiratory issues: cough, crackles, infiltrates on X-ray. Chlamydia trachomatis can cause pneumonia in newborns, called chlamydial pneumonia, which typically presents around 3 weeks of life with respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis. Since the baby is 13 days old, that's within the timeframe. \n\nGonococcal conjunctivitis is more severe, with purulent discharge and swelling, but it usually presents earlier, like within 2-5 days of birth. The discharge here is mucoid, not purulent, so maybe chlamydia. Also, the lung infiltrates and hyperinflation (which might indicate bronchopulmonary dysplasia but in this context more likely pneumonia) support chlamydia. \n\nTreatment for chlamydial conjunctivitis and pneumonia in newborns is systemic antibiotics. Erythromycin oral suspension is typically used. Option D is oral erythromycin. Topical erythromycin (E) would treat the eyes but not the pneumonia.

On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 70-year-old woman brought to the ED confused, with generalized pain. Her vital signs are mostly normal except maybe the blood pressure is a bit on the lower side (64 mmHg diastolic, but 129/64 is still within normal range). The key findings here are the 4+ blood in the urine and dark-colored urine. The ECG is mentioned but not shown, so maybe the answer doesn't rely on that. \n\nFirst, the confusion and dark urine with hematuria (4+ blood) make me think of rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdo can cause myoglobinuria, which darkens the urine. The generalized pain could be muscle aches from rhabdo. But what causes rhabdomyolysis in an elderly person? Maybe a fall leading to muscle injury, but she was found on the floor, so maybe she had a collapse rather than a fall. Alternatively, medications like statins, but the question doesn't mention that. \n\nAnother possibility is acute kidney injury from another cause, but the dark urine points more towards myoglobin. The next step in management for rhabdomyolysis is usually aggressive IV fluids to prevent kidney damage. Let's look at the options. \n\nOption D is IV fluid resuscitation. That's a common first step. But wait, the options also include other things. Let's see the other options. \n\nOption C is insulin, glucose, and fluids. That's more for hyperkalemia, but would that be the case here? If the ECG shows hyperkalemia (like peaked T waves), then maybe. But the question doesn't mention K levels. The dark urine could also be from hemolysis, but that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ECG shows something like peaked T waves (hyperkalemia). If the ECG in Figure A (not shown here) has that, then hyperkalemia would be a consideration. But since we can't see the ECG, maybe the question expects us to go with the urinalysis findings. \n\nThe dipstick shows 4+ blood and dark urine. Rhabdomyolysis would lead to myoglobinuria, which can cause dark urine and hematuria on dipstick. The treatment is fluids. So IV fluids (option D) would be the next step. \n\nAlternatively, if the ECG",

        "reason": "This patient presenting with secondary amenorrhea (defined as 6 or more consecutive months without menstruation in women who have passed menarche) and a history of rigorous exercise most likely has functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.\n\nFunctional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a condition in which relative caloric deficiency (whether through severe caloric restriction, increased energy expenditure, or increased stress) leads to functional disruption of the normal pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This in turn leads to decreased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), disruption to estrogen levels, and amenorrhea. A common associated clinical presentation is known as the \"female athlete triad\", which includes decreased calorie availability or increased energy expenditure through exercise, decreased bone mineral density due to a decrease in estrogen levels, and menstrual dysfunction. Treatment includes increasing caloric intake, behavioral therapy as needed, and possible estrogen replacement therapy.\n\nAckerman et al. reviews the role of estrogen replacement in improving bone mineral density in patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. The authors find that spine and femoral neck bone mineral density z-scores significantly increased with estrogen replacement. The authors recommend the use of transdermal estradiol over 12 months in improving bone mineral density in patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anorexia nervosa will often manifest with secondary amenorrhea in women. This patient has a normal BMI and no history of disordered eating. The mechanism of amenorrhea in the setting of anorexia nervosa relates to the same hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis at play in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea wherein the state of energy deficiency from inadequate caloric intake disrupts normal pulsatile GnRH secretion, leading to decreased FSH, LH, estrogen levels, and subsequent amenorrhea.\n\nAnswer C: Hypothyroidism is a cause of secondary amenorrhea wherein abnormal thyroid function can lead to altered levels of sex hormone-binding protein, prolactin, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, thus causing menstrual dysfunction. This patient does not present with other signs of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, sensitivity to cold, dry skin, muscle weakness, weight gain, constipation, joint stiffness, or thinning hair.\n\nAnswer D: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition often associated with obesity in which hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance is hypothesized to alter the hypothalamus feedback response, leading to the increased luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone ratio, increased androgen levels, and decreased rate of follicular maturation leading to unruptured follicles. Patients will often present with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, and decreased fertility.\n\nAnswer E: Pregnancy is a cause of secondary amenorrhea that is less likely in this patient given her lack of sexual history and other associated symptoms such as decreased appetite, nausea, and insomnia. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) test should always be part of the workup for secondary amenorrhea.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFunctional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a condition in which caloric restriction, increased energy expenditure through exercise, and/or increased stress leads to a disrupted pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with the downstream effect of amenorrhea.",

Zinc deficiency is common in patients with poor nutritional status such as the homeless, individuals living in developing nations without access to food, and patients with eating disorders. Many malabsorptive conditions can cause zinc deficiency including steatorrhea and chronic pancreatitis. Zinc deficiency presents with impaired wound healing and impaired immune function. Other symptoms suggestive of zinc deficiency include xerosis, alopecia, stomatitis, oral ulceration, angular cheilitis, impaired vision (night blindness), impaired smell/taste, diarrhea, and anorexia. The treatment of zinc deficiency involves zinc supplementation and workup for any other nutritional deficiencies.\n\nNagata etc al. study the incidence of zinc deficiency among younger patients with anorexia nervosa.

The key symptoms here are sparse hair falling out, a rash at the corners of his mouth, loose bowel movements, and a surgical wound that's not healing properly. The question is about a deficiency, so I need to link these symptoms to a vitamin or mineral deficiency.\n\nHomeless individuals often have poor nutrition, so deficiencies are possible. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption C is Vitamin C. Scurvy comes to mind. Symptoms of scurvy include gum issues (like bleeding or swelling), poor wound healing, fatigue, and skin manifestations like petechiae. But the question mentions a rash at the corners of the mouth, which might be angular stomatitis. Wait, angular stomatitis can be due to riboflavin (B2) deficiency. Hmm.\n\nVitamin C deficiency also causes hair changes, like hair that's easily pulled out (corkscrew hairs) and brittle hair. The wound not healing is a classic sign of Vitamin C deficiency because collagen synthesis is impaired. Without enough vitamin C, the body can't make collagen properly, so wounds don't heal well. That's a big point here.\n\nZinc deficiency (option E) also affects wound healing and can cause hair loss, diarrhea, and skin sores. The rash at the corners of the mouth might be angular cheilitis, which can be from B vitamins or iron, but zinc deficiency can also cause that. However, the key here is the combination of symptoms. Let me think again.\n\nThe patient has loose stools (diarrhea), which can occur in both zinc and vitamin C deficiencies. But the wound healing is a major clue. Both zinc and vitamin C are important for wound healing. However, the angular stomatitis (corners of the mouth) is more commonly associated with riboflavin (B2) or iron deficiency. Wait, but the hair loss is also a sign of zinc deficiency. \n\nWait, let me list the symptoms again:\n\n- Hair loss (alopecia)\n- Angular stomatitis (rash at mouth corners)\n- Diarrhea\n- Poor wound healing\n\nVitamin C deficiency (scurvy) includes:\n\n- Bleeding gums, swollen gums\n- Petechiae (small",

His tremor is present when doing tasks like brushing teeth and making coffee, which are voluntary movements. The physical exam shows a high-frequency bilateral hand tremor on finger-to-nose testing. His family history includes Parkinson's, but the tremor here is different. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what type of tremor this is. Parkinsonian tremors are typically resting tremors, like when the hands are at rest, and they have a lower frequency. This patient's tremor is action-related, specifically during movement (intention tremor or essential tremor). Essential tremor is a common cause of action tremors, and it can be exacerbated by factors like alcohol withdrawal or stress. The patient drinks 2-3 beers a day, which might be a coping mechanism if he's using alcohol to dampen the tremors, as alcohol can temporarily reduce essential tremor symptoms.\n\nThe options given are medications for tremors. Let's go through them:\n\nA) Alprazolam: A benzodiazepine, which can help with tremors, especially if anxiety is a component. But it's also used because alcohol and benzodiazepines have cross-tolerance; however, the patient is already drinking. Maybe not the first line here.\n\nB) Primidone: This is an anticonvulsant used for essential tremor. It's a first-line treatment for ET.\n\nC) Propranolol: A beta-blocker, also first-line for essential tremor, especially if it's postural or action-induced. Since the tremor here is action-related, propranolol is a good candidate.\n\nD) Topiramate: Another anticonvulsant, but maybe used for other types of tremors or if others aren't working. Not first-line.\n\nE) Trihexyphenidyl: An anticholinergic, typically used for Parkinson's disease to reduce tremors. But since this might not be Parkinson's, and the tremor is action, maybe not the best.\n\nThe key points: High-frequency action tremor, improving during the day (unlike PD which is worse at rest), family history of PD but the presentation doesn't fit PD.

Whereas the eviscerated bowel in gastroschisis is not covered by a membrane, the exposed bowel in the omphalocele is covered by a membranous sac. The abdominal wall defect in gastroschisis is located lateral to the umbilicus, whereas in omphalocele the defect is midline. The distinction is also important for management, as omphalocele is commonly associated with other extraintestinal defects whereas fewer than 10% of cases of gastroschisis are associated with an extraintestinal abnormality.

This disease presents in infants aged 2-6 months with progressive neurodegeneration, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and a \u201ccherry red\u201d spot on the macula. Tay-Sachs disease shares many features with Niemann-Pick disease; however, Niemann-Pick disease presents with the additional findings of hepatosplenomegaly and hyporeflexia whereas Tay-Sachs presents with hyperreflexia without hepatosplenomegaly. Both diseases are more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. There is no curative treatment for this disease so treatment is generally supportive.\n\nSolovyeva et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Tay-Sachs disease.

        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a 6-month-old boy with some developmental issues. The parents mention he was rolling both ways a few weeks ago but now struggles on his back. Now he can't roll from back to front, can't sit without support, and no bouncing when held. The physical exam shows hyperreflexia (patellar 4+), and there's an ocular finding in Figure A which I can't see, but maybe it's something like cherry-red spots? The question is about which substance accumulates in his cells.\n\nFirst, let's think about the developmental milestones. At 6 months, typical milestones include sitting with support, maybe rolling over. This baby isn't sitting without support and can't roll from back to front, which is a regression because he could do it before. Regression in motor skills is a red flag. The hyperreflexia and the ocular finding might be key here.\n\nThe options are different storage diseases. Let's recall each:\n\nA) Cerebroside sulfate \u2013 That's metachromatic leukodystrophy. It's a storage disease where there's a deficiency of arylsulfatase A, leading to accumulation of cerebroside sulfate. Symptoms usually start later, maybe after 1 year, but I'm not sure.\n\nB) Galactocerebroside \u2013 That's Krabbe disease. Krabbe is another leukodystrophy, caused by galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase deficiency. It often presents in infancy with irritability, seizures, and rapid neurodegeneration. The age here is 6 months, which fits. The ocular finding in Krabbe can be cherry-red spots in the macula.\n\nC) Glucocerebroside \u2013 That's Gaucher disease. Gaucher is more about organomegaly, bone issues, but usually doesn't have the cherry-red spots or the same neuro issues unless it's the neuronopathic form (type 2 or 3). Type 2 is acute infantile, which can present with developmental delay, but maybe the reflexes here are hyperactive. But Gaucher's might have hepatosplenomegaly, which the patient doesn't have here (abdomen is soft, no hepatosplenomegaly). So maybe not C.\n\nD) GM2-ganglioside \u2013 That's Tay-Sachs disease.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs in almost all patients with MEN2B and is often metastatic at the time of diagnosis.

Thyroid nodules can be benign or malignant. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy might suggest something more concerning, like thyroid cancer metastasizing to lymph nodes. But what else?\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA) Elevated plasma metanephrines: These are related to pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, which are adrenal issues. Not directly related to thyroid, unless the nodule is a medullary carcinoma, which produces calcitonin, not metanephrines. Maybe not the best fit.\n\nB) Elevated serum calcium: Hypercalcemia can occur with hyperparathyroidism, but thyroid issues? Maybe if there's a parathyroid adenoma, but the nodule is thyroid. Alternatively, if the thyroid cancer is medullary, maybe? Or maybe lymphoma? Not sure yet.\n\nC) Elevated prolactin: That's usually from a pituitary issue, like a prolactinoma. But how does that connect here? Unless there's a pituitary problem, but the patient's presentation doesn't mention anything related to that. Maybe not.\n\nD) Fasting hypoglycemia: Could be from insulinoma, but again, not directly linked to thyroid.

Wait, maybe if the thyroid nodule is a functioning one, but hyperthyroidism usually causes high blood pressure, but his BP is normal. Not sure.\n\nE) Positive fecal occult blood: That's more GI related. Unless there's a malignancy elsewhere, but the main issue here is thyroid and lymph nodes. Maybe not.\n\nWait, the patient is sexually active with men. Could there be an infectious cause? Like HIV? If he has HIV, maybe he has lymphadenopathy (common in HIV) and maybe a thyroid issue.

The Tzanck smear showing multinucleated giant cells further confirms the diagnosis though the diagnosis is typically made on clinical grounds and treated empirically. Acyclovir is the drug of choice for treating HSV-2 as it inhibits viral DNA polymerase, preventing the virus from replicating. The drug can reduce the duration and severity of symptoms but does not eradicate the virus entirely.\n\nGroves (2016) emphasizes that genital herpes, caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), affects over 400 million people worldwide. The infection is lifelong, with vesicular outbreaks in genital areas that can ulcerate. While HSV-1 and HSV-2 are both culprits, the latter increases the risk of HIV acquisition.

The key points here are the symptoms and the physical exam findings. She denies recent travel, new sexual partners, or antibiotics. The exam shows clustered vesicles and ulcers on the vulva. The Tzanck smear shows multinucleated giant cells.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's causing her symptoms. The presence of clustered vesicles and ulcers in the genital area makes me think of a viral infection, possibly herpes simplex virus (HSV). The Tzanck smear result supports that because multinucleated giant cells are indicative of viral infection, like HSV. \n\nNow, the options given are Acyclovir (A), Amoxicillin (B), Fluconazole (C), Metronidazole (D), and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (E). \n\nAcyclovir is an antiviral, specifically used for herpes infections. That seems like a good fit here. The other options are antibiotics or antifungals. Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which wouldn't help a viral infection. Fluconazole is for fungal infections, which don't typically present with vesicles and ulcers like this. Metronidazole is an antibiotic used for bacterial infections, like bacterial vaginosis or certain STDs such as trichomoniasis, but those usually don't present with vesicles. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is also an antibiotic, used for UTIs or pneumonia, but again not for viral. \n\nThe Tzanck smear result is crucial here. Multinucleated giant cells are a sign of viral infection, so that points away from bacterial or fungal. Since the question is about treatment, the correct choice should be an antiviral. So Acyclovir (A) is the answer. \n\nWait, but could there be another condition? Let me think. Primary syphilis can present with a chancre, but that's usually a single ulcer, not clustered. The patient denies new sexual partners, but that's not always reliable. However, the Tzanck smear in syphilis wouldn't show multinucleated giant cells. The clustered vesicles are more typical of HSV.

However, she has persistent symptoms (diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, nontender goiter) despite maximum doses of these medications, which should then be treated with surgical thyroidectomy which can be performed safely in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy.\n\nGraves disease is caused by TSH receptor antibodies that activate the TSH receptor to synthesize thyroid hormone, leading to hyperthyroidism with suppressed TSH levels. The initial treatment for Graves disease is symptom control with a beta-blocker (e.g., propranolol) and inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with a thionamide (e.g., propylthiouracil or methimazole). In the 1st trimester of pregnancy, propylthiouracil is preferred to methimazole. In the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, methimazole is the preferred thionamide. The treatment of choice in pregnancy for Graves disease that is refractory to propranolol and a thionamide is thyroidectomy, which can safely be performed in the 2nd trimester. This is reserved only for more severe cases refractory to medical treatment. In nonpregnant patients, radioiodine ablation is the preferred treatment for refractory Graves disease but is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of ablating the fetal thyroid.\n\nDavies et al. reviewed the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Graves disease. They found that Graves disease is caused by autoantibodies to the TSH receptor, resulting in overactive thyroid hormone secretion. They recommend that Graves's disease be treated with antithyroid drugs, radioiodine ablation, or surgery depending on clinical characteristics.\n\nFigure A demonstrates goiter, a common finding in Graves disease that reflects thyroid growth in response to activation by TSH receptor antibodies.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Continuing routine prenatal care does not address the symptoms of the patient's hyperthyroidism. Poorly-controlled hyperthyroidism can lead to spontaneous abortion, premature labor, low birth weight, heart failure, and preeclampsia in pregnant individuals. Therefore, Graves disease should be treated in pregnant individuals.\n\nAnswer B: Methimazole is a thionamide that is an alternative to propylthiouracil in nonpregnant individuals. It is more potent than propylthiouracil. Methimazole is contraindicated during the 1st trimester of pregnancy due to its teratogenic effects on the fetus during organogenesis.\n\nAnswer C: Oral iodinated contrast agents inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 and may be used in thyroid storm in nonpregnant patients outside of the United States. Patients with thyroid storm present with tachycardia, arrhythmias, heart failure, and hyperpyrexia.\n\nAnswer D: Radioiodine ablation is the preferred definitive treatment for Graves disease in nonpregnant individuals. It is contraindicated in pregnancy as fetal thyroid tissue has developed by 10-12 weeks of gestation and may be ablated alongside the maternal tissue.\n\nBullet Summary:\nInitial treatment of Graves disease in pregnancy is propranolol and propylthiouracil, whereas severe symptoms that are refractory to medical management should be treated with thyroidectomy.",

She was started on propranolol and propylthiouracil (PTU), but even at maximum doses, she's still having symptoms like sweating and palpitations.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. I remember that antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are the first-line treatment. The two main options are PTU and methimazole (MMI). However, there are some considerations during pregnancy. PTU is typically preferred in the first trimester due to a lower risk of certain birth defects associated with MMI, especially in early pregnancy. But after the first trimester, some guidelines might shift to MMI because PTU has been linked to rare but serious liver issues. Since she's now at 12 weeks, which is the end of the first trimester, maybe switching to methimazole would be better here?\n\nThe question states that she's on maximum doses of both propranolol and PTU but still has symptoms.

The options given are: continue routine care (A), switch to methimazole (B), oral iodinated contrast (C), radioiodine (D), or thyroidectomy in the second trimester (E).\n\nRadioiodine (D) is contraindicated in pregnancy because iodine is taken up by the thyroid and can cross the placenta, potentially harming the fetus's thyroid development. So D is out. Oral iodinated contrast (C) might be used for imaging, but in the context of hyperthyroidism, iodine can sometimes be used as a short-term treatment to block thyroid hormone release, but usually in preparation for surgery or before ablation. However, since radioiodine isn't an option here, maybe C isn't the right choice. \n\nThyroidectomy (E) is a surgical option, typically considered if medications fail or aren't tolerated, especially in pregnancy.

Patients usually present with back or neck pain, with or without fever, and the most common clinical finding is local tenderness to percussion over the involved posterior spinous process. Risk factors include injection drug use, degenerative spine disease, prior spinal surgery, infective endocarditis, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy, and other immunocompromised states. Vital signs may be normal, and laboratory evaluation commonly reveals an elevated white blood cell count, ESR, and CRP. An MRI of the spine is the most appropriate diagnostic test.

It typically does not result in radiculopathy, defined as irritation or injury of a nerve root, causing pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling in specific distributions depending on the location of the affected nerve root.

The ESR and CRP are both elevated, indicating inflammation.\n\nFirst, let's go through the options. \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (A) typically affects the sacroiliac joints and the lower back, but it's a chronic inflammatory condition, usually starting in younger adults, and it's associated with HLA-B27. The pain is often worse in the morning and improves with activity, which contradicts the given that pain is worse with physical activity here. So maybe not A.\n\nDegenerative spine disease (B) like arthritis or herniated discs are common, but the elevated inflammatory markers might not be as high. Degenerative issues might present with chronic pain but maybe not such a rapid increase over 4 weeks. Also, the tenderness at L2-L3 is a bit higher than typical lumbar issues, which are more common lower down. Not sure yet.\n\nHerniated disc (C) usually causes radicular pain, like sciatica, with radiation down the leg. The question says the pain is localized to the back, so maybe less likely unless it's a central herniation, but the inflammation markers are high here, which isn't typical for a herniated disc. So probably not C.\n\nMetastatic tumor (D) can cause back pain, especially in someone with a history of cancer, but the patient has no past surgical history mentioned, and IV drug use isn't directly linked to metastases. However, metastases can occur from primary cancers like prostate, lung, etc. But the elevated ESR and CRP might be due to the tumor, but osteomyelitis also causes these. Need to think more.\n\nOsteomyelitis (E) is an infection of the bone. IV drug users are at high risk for osteomyelitis because they can have bacteremia leading to seeding in the bones. The location at L2-L3 with tenderness, along with markedly elevated ESR (112 is very high) and CRP (10 is also high) points towards an inflammatory process. Osteomyel",

The most appropriate next step in management is a fine needle aspiration (FNA).\n\nThe first step in the diagnostic work-up of a thyroid nodule, which can be found incidentally in asymptomatic individuals or in the presence of obstructive or vocal symptoms, includes an ultrasound and measurement of serum TSH levels. If TSH is normal or elevated, this suggests a hypofunctioning (\u201ccold\u201d) nodule, which increases the risk of cancer. These nodules should undergo FNA if suspicious sonographic findings are present. Suspicious sonographic findings include irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, and rim calcifications in nodules \u2265 1 cm in diameter. If TSH is low, then thyroid scintigraphy (radioiodine scan) should be performed to confirm whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning (\u201chot\u201d). Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely cancerous, so these patients can often avoid FNA. Hyperfunctioning nodules such as toxic adenomas which cause overt hyperthyroid symptoms may warrant further treatment with radioiodine, surgery, or anti-thyroid medications.\n\nDurante et al. review the epidemiology and diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules. The authors find that nodules with suspicious sonographic patterns such as solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should undergo cytological evaluation. The authors recommend molecular testing only in cases in which cytology is indeterminate.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Propylthiouracil is a thionamide that inhibits thyroid peroxidase, thus preventing thyroid hormone synthesis. It can be used for the symptomatic control of hyperthyroidism in toxic adenomas prior to definitive surgical resection. It is not indicated for the treatment of a hypofunctioning nodule.\n\nAnswer C: Radioiodine ablation can be used in the treatment of a toxic adenoma, which would take up the radioactive iodine. It is not indicated for the treatment of a hypofunctioning nodule, which would not exhibit radioiodine uptake.\n\nAnswer D: Surgical removal of the mass is a treatment option for a malignant thyroid nodule. Although a hypofunctioning nodule is more likely to be malignant, an FNA should be performed first to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAnswer E: Thyroid scintigraphy is used for thyroid nodules with low TSH, which increases the probability of a hyperfunctioning nodule. Confirmation of a hyperfunctioning nodule can help prevent further invasive diagnostic work-up because hyperfunctioning nodules are unlikely to be malignant. Thyroid scintigraphy would not be appropriate in this patient with an elevated TSH.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe next step in management for a thyroid nodule with suspicious sonographic features and an elevated TSH is fine needle aspiration.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. She's asymptomatic but has a neck mass found during her annual check-up. The mass is located inferior to the cricoid cartilage on the left side, and the ultrasound shows a hypoechoic mass with microcalcifications. Her TSH is 7.2, which is elevated, indicating possible hypothyroidism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the neck mass could be. The location inferior to the cricoid is in the thyroid area. The ultrasound findings of hypoechoic mass with microcalcifications are concerning for a thyroid nodule. The presence of microcalcifications is a known ultrasound feature that can be a sign of malignancy, so that raises the suspicion.\n\nThe TSH is elevated, which suggests that the thyroid isn't making enough hormone, so the pituitary is releasing more TSH to stimulate it. But how does that relate to the nodule? An elevated TSH could indicate primary hypothyroidism, but sometimes a cold nodule (non-functioning) might cause the TSH to be high because the nodule isn't producing thyroid hormone, but the rest of the gland might be underactive. Alternatively, if the nodule was hyperfunctioning (a hot nodule), TSH would be low. Since her TSH is high, the nodule is likely not hyperfunctioning.\n\nThe question is about the next step in management. The options are fine needle aspiration (FNA), propylthiouracil (an antithyroid medication), radioiodine ablation, surgical removal, or thyroid scintigraphy (which is a nuclear scan to see if the nodule is hot or cold).\n\nThe standard approach for a thyroid nodule with ultrasound features that raise suspicion (like microcalcifications, which are a sonographic criterion for increased cancer risk) is to proceed with a fine needle aspiration biopsy. FNA is the first-line diagnostic test to evaluate the cytology and determine if the nodule is malignant. \n\nThyroid scintigraphy (option E) would tell if the nodule is \"hot\" or \"cold,\" but since the ultrasound already shows suspicious features, the next step isn't imaging but rather a biopsy. Scintigraphy might be done in some cases, but when there are suspicious ultrasound features, FNA is more important. \n\nPropylthi",

Given his obesity, worsening home blood glucose levels, and desire for improved sexual performance, bupropion is an appropriate medication.\n\nBupropion is an antidepressant that is not used first-line except in certain circumstances. Situations where bupropion is an appropriate agent for the management of depression include smoking cessation as it decreases smoking cravings. Bupropion is also weight neutral and is preferred in obese patients, patients who are gaining weight on other medications, and patients with poorly-managed diabetes. Finally, it does not have any sexual side effects in contrast to SSRIs. However, bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and should be avoided in patients at higher risk for seizures. Bupropion is sometimes given with other antidepressants for patients with persistent or refractory symptoms.\n\nPatel et al. review bupropion. They note the effectiveness of bupropion in managing depression and note that it can be given with other agents. They recommend its use, in particular, for smoking cessation or patients who need a more weight-neutral treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Electroconvulsive therapy is a highly effective therapy for depression; however, it is generally used in cases of severe suicidality, malnutrition due to food refusal secondary to depressive disorder, or last line when other medications have failed. This patient is primarily experiencing sexual side-effects and has gained weight, making bupropion a more viable initial alternative.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is merely a different SSRI that will lead to similar side effects. Thus, it would not be appropriate. Changing SSRIs is appropriate if the first SSRI does not work after an appropriate trial period of at least 4 weeks in the management of depression. Other changes when an SSRI fails to control symptoms include increasing the dose.\n\nAnswer D: Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that increases appetite and leads to weight gain and would further worsen this patient\u2019s obesity. It is preferred in conditions such as anorexia nervosa given weight gain is preferable in this population.\n\nAnswer E: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and is usually used third-line (or later) in the management of depression given side-effects such as hypertensive crisis and the long washout period and interactions with other medications. Bupropion is a safer initial alternative.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with depression who experience sexual side effects or weight gain on SSRIs may be switched to bupropion.",

The patient is a 45-year-old man with obesity, depression managed by fluoxetine, and now he's having issues with orgasm. He wants to stop the medication because of that. Also, his blood glucose levels have been higher lately. The doctor wants to switch his antidepressant, so we need to pick the best option from the given choices.\n\nFirst, let's recall the side effects of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Common sexual side effects with SSRIs include decreased libido, delayed or absent orgasm. But the patient here says his sexual drive has increased, but he can't achieve orgasm. Wait, that's a bit conflicting. Usually, SSRIs can reduce libido, but maybe in this case, his libido is up, but the orgasm issue is the problem. Anyway, the main issue here is the anorgasmia leading him to stop the medication.\n\nThe question is about switching to another antidepressant that doesn't have that side effect. Also, the patient has diabetes with higher blood glucose. So we need to consider medications that don't affect glucose levels negatively.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Bupropion: This is an atypical antidepressant, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It's known for having minimal sexual side effects, sometimes even improving libido. That's a good candidate because the patient's libido is okay, but he can't orgasm. Bupropion might not cause that issue. Also, it's weight-neutral or can even cause weight loss, which is good for someone with obesity and diabetes.\n\nB) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): That's a last-resort treatment for severe depression that doesn't respond to meds. The question says his depression is well-managed, so ECT isn't needed here. Probably not the answer.\n\nC) Escitalopram: Another SSRI. Since the current problem is from an SSRI (fluoxetine), switching to another SSRI might not help the orgasm issue. In fact, it could have similar sexual side effects. So probably not the best choice.\n\nD) Mirtazapine: This is a tetracyclic antidepressant. It acts as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). It's known to cause sedation and weight gain. Since the patient has diabetes and his blood glucose is up, adding a medication that",

These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction. They discuss how an ACE inhibitor is the standard of care in patients currently.

In the setting of patients with myocardial infarctions, inhibition of detrimental ventricular remodeling is key for lowering mortality.\n\nAnswer C: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to reduce blood pressure; however, it does not reduce mortality in patients who have experienced an MI. Calcium channel blockers tend to have few side effects and can be safely started in most patients.\n\nAnswer D: Continuing current medications and scheduling a follow-up appointment misses the opportunity for the patient to be started on a mortality-lowering ACE inhibitor. In patients who are amenable to starting a new medication, an ACE inhibitor should be administered to all patients who have sustained an MI.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to carvedilol would be unnecessary and not likely to benefit this patient as much as adding an ACE inhibitor. Metoprolol is the preferred beta blocker in patients who have sustained an MI.

Whereas the PR interval in Mobitz type 1 becomes progressively longer with each beat, the PR intervals in Mobitz type 2 are consistent in length and the QRS complexes drop suddenly. While Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction, Mobitz type 2 is caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. Patients with either type of heart block can present with lightheadedness or syncope. Since this pattern has a risk of progressing into 3rd-degree heart block, hemodynamic compromise, and asystole, Mobitz type 2 heart block is an indication for placement of a permanent pacemaker. Unstable patients who do not respond to atropine and/or other medical management should undergo transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.\n\nClark and Prystowsky present the pathophysiology of heart block.

The ECG is mentioned but we can't see it. He was given atropine which didn't work.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the recent heart surgery (mitral valve repair) and the current symptoms. The bradycardia and hypotension suggest a possible issue with his heart rate leading to inadequate cardiac output. Since he just had valve surgery, maybe there's a problem with the conduction system. The atropine not working is important because atropine is first-line for bradycardia, especially if it's due to decreased vagal tone or 2nd/3rd degree heart block. But if atropine doesn't help, then we need to think about other causes or next steps.\n\nThe options are adenosine, atropine again, cardioversion, procainamide, or transvenous pacing. Let's go through them. Adenosine is for SVT or PSVT, but he has a slow heart rate (48), so that's probably not it. Atropine was already tried and didn't work. Cardioversion is for rhythms like VTach or SVT with poor perfusion, but his rhythm is irregular. Procainamide is a calcium channel blocker, maybe for SVT or VTach, but again, not sure. Transvenous pacing is for high-degree heart block where the heart is too slow and not responding to atropine. Since he's post-valve surgery, maybe he developed a complete heart block, which is a surgical complication. In that case, pacing would be needed.

If free air is seen on the abdominal radiograph, patients should be taken for emergent surgery to repair the perforation. If bowel perforation is ruled out, a workup should be done to determine the etiology of the delayed passage, which would most likely include a contrast enema to differentiate between meconium ileus and Hirschsprung disease. Treatment is with meconium removal or excision of the defective segment respectively.\n\nAdams and Stanton review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal bowel obstruction. They discuss how malrotation, jejunoileal atresia, duodenal atresia, and colonic atresia are common causes of this finding. They recommend surgical management of these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: An abdominal radiograph would be faster than an abdominal CT to rule out an indication for emergency surgery. The use of CT should also be restricted in the pediatric population due to the radiation exposure involved. Adult patients with unclear radiographic findings can be further assessed using a contrast CT scan.\n\nAnswer C: Contrast enema is the test of choice to differentiate meconium ileus from Hirschsprung disease, but the most important first step is to rule out bowel perforation. Patients who do not have perforation can then undergo this test to determine the etiology of failure to pass meconium.\n\nAnswer D: Sweat testing would aid in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, particularly in this patient who has had no prenatal screening. The first step in management should be an abdominal radiograph to rule out bowel perforation. Cystic fibrosis can be treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement and pulmonary therapy.\n\nAnswer E: Upper gastrointestinal series is used to make the diagnosis of intestinal malrotation, which more commonly presents with bilious vomiting secondary to midgut volvulus rather than the delayed passage of meconium. Treatment is with surgical derotation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nNeonates who fail to pass meconium in the first 48 hours of life should be urgently evaluated with an abdominal radiograph to rule out bowel perforation.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 3-day-old boy with delayed meconium passage. He's breastfed, feeding well, and urinating frequently. Born at 35 weeks to a mom who had preterm labor. Ashkenazi Jewish descent, parents refused prenatal genetic testing. Siblings are healthy. On exam, he's in moderate distress, distended abdomen, non-tender, no bowel sounds.\n\nHmm, delayed meconium in a newborn can be a sign of Hirschsprung's disease, which is more common in males and has a genetic component, especially in certain ethnic groups like Ashkenazi Jews. The absence of bowel sounds and distension point to possible intestinal obstruction. Since he's 3 days old and hasn't passed meconium, that's a red flag.\n\nThe options are CT, abdominal X-ray, contrast enema, sweat test, or upper GI series. Let's think. Hirschsprung's is a common cause here. The classic test is a barium enema, which can show the transition zone between normal and aganglionic bowel. But contrast enema (option C) is often the first step. An abdominal X-ray (B) might show distended loops and maybe a transition point, but contrast enema is more definitive. CT isn't typically used in newborns due to radiation. Sweat testing is for cystic fibrosis, which can also cause meconium ileus, but that's more associated with meconium plug and often presents with meconium in the first 24 hours. Since the parents are Ashkenazi, maybe considering CF, but the question mentions delayed meconium, not ileus. Also, the absence of bowel sounds and distension make me think mechanical obstruction. The contrast enema would be the next step to check for Hirschsprung's. Upper GI series (E) is for other issues like intestinal atresia, but the key here is the colon. So the answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC",

After a physical exam is performed in order to rule out signs or symptoms of a severe organic cause (neurologic deficits), the most appropriate initial step in management is to discuss sleep hygiene with the patient. Sleep hygiene includes discussing the patient\u2019s exposure to light (eliminate exposure to blue light at night), altering diet (no large meals or caffeine before bed), and behavioral modification (only using the bed for sleep). Once a trial of proper sleep hygiene has been tried, then it would be appropriate to potentially move on to other interventions including pharmacological interventions.\n\nHorne presents evidence regarding the best sleep hygiene practices. He discusses how exercise and avoidance of caffeine near bedtime is beneficial to helping with insomnia. He recommends using these interventions prior to pharmacologic treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that could be used to help with this patient\u2019s anxiety and could help them sleep. However, benzodiazepines are potent drugs with addictive properties and would not be used as first-line treatment for insomnia. Lifestyle modifications should be tried first to determine if these will be effective in helping the patient sleep.\n\nAnswer B: Melatonin is a supplement that is often used to improve sleep quality. Starting the patient on a supplement is plausible as an initial step in management, but it would not take precedence over educating the patient regarding sleep hygiene. These interventions often are very effective and have no side effects.\n\nAnswer C: Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if an organic cause for this patient\u2019s sleep problems (such as obstructive sleep apnea) is suspected.

He's having trouble sleeping despite going to bed early, which is affecting his studies. He uses cocaine and marijuana occasionally. His vitals are normal, and the physical exam is normal except for looking tired and anxious.\n\nThe question is about the most appropriate initial management step. The options are Alprazolam (a benzodiazepine), Melatonin (a supplement for sleep), Polysomnography (a sleep study), Sleep hygiene education, or Zolpidem (a sedative-hypnotic).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible causes of his insomnia. He mentions substance use: cocaine and marijuana. Cocaine is a stimulant and can definitely cause insomnia, while marijuana's effects on sleep are mixed but might disrupt sleep cycles. Since he's a young adult with no significant medical history, maybe the substances are contributing to his sleep issues. \n\nThe initial step in managing insomnia, especially when there's possible substance use, should address the root cause. The first line of treatment for insomnia often includes non-pharmacological approaches. Sleep hygiene education (option D) is usually recommended before medications. That includes things like maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding stimulants, creating a good sleep environment, etc. Since he's using substances that can interfere with sleep, advising him to stop or reduce their use would be part of that education.\n\nThe other options: Alprazolam and Zolpidem are medications. But given that he's using substances, prescribing another sedative might not be safe, especially benzodiazepines which can interact with other drugs or lead to dependency. Melatonin is a supplement, but evidence for its effectiveness in primary insomnia isn't strong, and again, maybe not the first step. Polysomnography is a diagnostic test for sleep disorders like apnea, but his exam is normal, and there's no mention of other symptoms like snoring or witnessed pauses in breathing. So maybe that's not needed yet.\n\nSo the best initial step would be to start with sleep hygiene education and addressing the substance use. Therefore, the answer is D.\n</think>\n\nD",

Risk factors for AAA include advanced age (> 60 years), smoking history, male sex, and history of atherosclerosis. AAA can be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic until it markedly expands or ruptures, leading to abdominal pain, back pain, or flank pain. The evaluation of suspected AAA depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient and prior knowledge (or lack thereof) of the existence of an AAA. A hemodynamically unstable patient with a known history of AAA should be assumed to have a ruptured AAA and undergo surgical intervention without further workup (though bedside ultrasound can support the diagnosis). In an unstable patient without a known history, a bedside ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis should precede surgical intervention. In a hemodynamically stable patient with or without a known AAA history, an abdominal CTA is appropriate.\n\nSakalihasan et al. present a review of the presentation and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. They discuss how patients are often asymptomatic until catastrophic rupture occurs. They recommend immediate surgical repair of the aneurysm during ruptures to prevent death.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer A: Acute pancreatitis also presents with abdominal pain and can present with hemodynamic instability in severe cases of hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis. This is a rare entity and is less likely in this patient. Treatment is immediate transcatheter arterial embolization for unstable patients with hemorrhagic pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer B: Aortic dissection has similar risk factors to AAA (history of hypertension, advanced age) and also presents with acute onset back pain. Dissection normally occurs in the setting of hypertension. This diagnosis is possible but less likely in this man with a history of smoking.\n\nAnswer C: Ischemic colitis can also present with abdominal pain in a patient with risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. It is associated with hematochezia and diarrhea and is unlikely to cause the level of hypotension in this patient. Treatment is with restoration of blood flow to the ischemic bowel segment or resection if this is not possible. Management is usually centered on medical optimization.\n\nAnswer D: Perforated viscus is a surgical emergency that can also present acutely with hemodynamic instability and severe abdominal pain. However, signs of peritoneal irritation are usually present (guarding, rigidity).

Of the answer choices, only patching the sound eye (right eye) is an appropriate treatment.\n\nStrabismus occurs when a patient's eyes are not aligned properly. It often presents in children with one or both eyes turning inward, outward, upward, or downward. Patients will often tilt their heads or squint their eyes to correct this misalignment. Without proper treatment, there is a significant risk of developing amblyopia. Amblyopia is a developmental disorder in the visual cortex caused by abnormal visual stimuli. Untreated strabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia; it is secondary to visual loss from the deviated eye. The treatment of choice is wearing an eye patch over the appropriately tracking eye (sound eye), thereby encouraging the use of the deviated eye and preventing vision loss in this eye. Other treatments include surgical correction of strabismus, pharmacological penalization of the sound eye with atropine, and dichoptic movies and video games.\n\nGopal et al. discuss the pathophysiology, prevention, and therapy for amblyopia as it relates to strabismus. The authors find that the earlier clinically refractive error and strabismus are detected and treated, the greater the likelihood of preventing amblyopia. The authors recommend treating amblyopia with the correction of refractive errors, patching, and pharmacologic treatments.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows displacement of the light reflex from the center of the pupil in this patient's right eye, as indicated by the black arrow. This is known as an asymmetric corneal light reflex and is seen in strabismus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Brain MRI is part of the initial workup for retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma typically presents in early childhood with visual loss, leukocoria, and an abnormal red reflex, which this patient does not have.\n\nAnswer B: Head CT in a pediatric patient could be used to rule out hemorrhage following blunt head trauma. This patient has not experienced head trauma and has no symptoms of traumatic brain injury (abnormal neurologic exam, loss of consciousness seizures). CT scans are not preferred in pediatric patients to avoid radiation exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Patching the left eye (the inappropriately tracking eye) would not treat this patient's strabismus and would likely increase his risk for amblyopia due to further decreasing his visual stimuli in this eye.\n\nAnswer E: The Bielschowsky head tilt test is used to help diagnose trochlear nerve (CN IV) palsy. Patients with a unilateral trochlear nerve and subsequent superior oblique palsy experience double vision when tilting their head to one side, which is improved by tilting the head towards the shoulder on the unaffected side. A trochlear nerve palsy typically presents with difficulty looking down and a head tilt away from the side of the lesion, unlike this patient who appears to have a visual acuity deficit.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatching the appropriately aligned eye is the treatment of choice for strabismus to prevent progression to amblyopia.",

The rest of the neurological exam is normal.\n\nHmm, so the key here is figuring out what's causing the eye wandering. The fact that the left eye drifts when not covered but corrects when the right is covered suggests a possible strabismus. Strabismus is when the eyes don't align properly. Now, the next step in management options are given. Let's think about each option.\n\nOption A is a brain MRI. That's a big test. Usually, you might consider imaging if there's a suspicion of a structural issue in the brain causing the strabismus, but the question mentions that the neurological exam is normal, including extraocular movements.

Again, unless there's a trauma or some other red flag, which isn't mentioned here, probably not needed right away.\n\nOption C is patching the left eye. Wait, patching is often used for amblyopia, which is lazy eye. If one eye is patched, the other has to work, which can help strengthen the weaker eye. But in this case, the left eye is the one that's wandering. If when the right is covered, the left can focus, maybe the right is the dominant one? Or perhaps the left is the amblyopic eye. Wait, the question says when focusing on the penlight, the left eye wanders. So when both eyes are open, the left is deviating. But when the right is covered, the left can focus. That suggests that the left eye can see when the right is closed. So maybe the left eye is the one with better vision, but it's deviating? Or maybe the right eye is the one with the problem. Wait, maybe it's a case of intermittent exotropia or esotropia. But the key here is the next step.\n\nOption D is patching the right eye.

The most severe neonatal complication of Hirschsprung disease is Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis, which presents in the first few weeks to months of life with explosive diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain/distension. The most appropriate first step to diagnose Hirschsprung disease is a contrast enema, which may visualize a \u201ctransition zone\u201d where the caliber of the intestine switches from the dilated proximal colon to the narrowed aganglionic segment. The most accurate test is a rectal suction biopsy, which will show a lack of ganglion cells.

Although meconium ileus presents with delayed passage of meconium (> 48 hours of life), meconium ileus is not relieved by a digital rectal exam. Treatment is with irrigation and removal of the meconium.\n\nAnswer C: Intraoperative cholangiogram is the gold standard for diagnosing biliary atresia. Biliary atresia presents with jaundice, pale stools or dark urine, and hepatomegaly over the first week to 2 months of life.

The digital rectal exam causing release of stool and gas might be a clue. The fever and low blood pressure suggest possible infection or sepsis, but the abdominal findings are prominent.\n\nHirschsprung disease comes to mind. Hirschsprung is a congenital condition where part of the colon lacks ganglion cells, leading to functional obstruction. Symptoms can include delayed passage of meconium (usually in the first 24-48 hours), vomiting, abdominal distension, and chronic constipation. The digital rectal exam might relieve the obstruction by allowing stool to pass, which is mentioned here. The patient had bilious vomiting early on, which can occur with intestinal obstruction.

        "question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to her physician for mood changes and recent falls over the course of 3 months. She feels more irritable with her husband and children and does not find pleasure in creating art anymore. Over the last 2 weeks, she has been sleeping approximately 5 hours a night and had a fall while walking in her home with the lights off. She denies any head trauma or loss of consciousness associated with the fall. She has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and hypothyroidism for which she takes escitalopram and levothyroxine. She had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 5 years ago. She has been in a monogamous relationship with her husband for the last 15 years and uses a copper intrauterine device. Physical examination is notable for a depressed affect. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. She has 4/5 strength in the bilateral lower extremities and brisk patellar reflexes. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "answer_idx": "D",
        "reason": "This patient's mood changes and findings concerning for subacute combined degeneration (fall in the dark, impaired proprioception, weakness, and brisk patellar reflexes), and history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery are concerning for vitamin B12 deficiency. Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased. It would not present with the abnormal neurologic findings seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRoux-en-Y bariatric surgery increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency via reduction of food intake, decreased functional parietal cell count, and reduced absorption of vitamin B12 (which may cause subacute combined degeneration).",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 37-year-old woman with mood changes, irritability, loss of pleasure in activities (like creating art), and recent falls over three months. She's been sleeping less (5 hours a night) recently. She has a history of generalized anxiety disorder and hypothyroidism, managed with escitalopram and levothyroxine. She had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass five years ago. The physical exam shows depressed affect, normal pupils, 4/5 strength in lower limbs, and brisk reflexes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible causes of her symptoms. The mood changes and loss of pleasure point towards depression, but the falls and neurological findings (muscle weakness, brisk reflexes) suggest a neurological issue. The gastric bypass is important here because it can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption A: Poor iron absorption. Gastric bypass can cause iron deficiency anemia, but would that explain the neurological symptoms? Maybe, but iron deficiency might present with fatigue, pallor, but the weakness and reflexes could be part of neuropathy. However, the brisk reflexes might not be typical of iron deficiency. Also, the mood changes could be part of anemia, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.\n\nOption B: Prior Treponema pallidum (syphilis) exposure. Neurosyphilis can cause mood changes and neurological symptoms. But she's in a monogamous relationship and uses a copper IUD, so maybe less likely unless there's a past exposure. But the question doesn't mention any history of syphilis or other signs like rash, etc. Not sure, but maybe possible.\n\nOption C: Reduced CNS dopamine and serotonin. These neurotransmitters are involved in mood (depression is linked to low serotonin and dopamine). The patient's symptoms of depression fit here, but the neurological findings (weakness, reflexes) might not be directly explained by that. Unless there's another condition affecting both, but maybe the question is pointing towards a deficiency due to surgery?\n\nOption D: Reduced functional parietal cell count. Parietal cells produce intrinsic factor, which is needed for B12 absorption. A gastric bypass would reduce parietal cells, leading to B12 deficiency. B12 deficiency can cause neuropathy, leading to weakness and reflex changes, as well as psychiatric symptoms like depression, irritability. That",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after being found outside with hypothermia and frostbite (dark bullae noted on the extremities in the setting of being out in the cold). Frostbite can lead to rhabdomyolysis, which may cause hyperkalemia (causing ECG changes including peaked T waves and QRS widening as seen in this patient) and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte finding in frostbite).\n\nFrostbite occurs when there is an extensive freezing injury to tissues and can cause benign swelling, erythema, and pain, all the way to insensate extremities with necrosis and permanent dysfunction. More severe forms of frostbite can cause rhabdomyolysis or breakdown of the muscles. Breakdown of the muscle cells leads to leakage of the intracellular contents. Common electrolyte derangements include hyperkalemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement in rhabdomyolysis. It occurs due to the deposition of calcium in the necrotic muscle cells and the sequestration of calcium in the exposed sarcoplasmic reticulum. Note that hypocalcemia requires no treatment unless it is causing symptoms or ECG changes (such as QT prolongation). The management of rhabdomyolysis is centered on fluid administration to protect the kidney from myoglobin which is released from damaged muscles and is nephrotoxic.\n\nZimmerman and Shen review rhabdomyolysis. They note that rhabdomyolysis can be commonly associated with myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia. They suggest that an elevated creatine kinase level is indicated to support the diagnosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating peaked T waves (blue arrows) which are associated with hyperkalemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Elevated troponin may be seen in rhabdomyolysis. This is a non-cardiac cause of an elevated troponin; however, this is less common than hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and is neither sensitive nor specific.\n\nAnswer C: Hypomagnesemia is not a common electrolyte disturbance seen in rhabdomyolysis; however, hypomagnesemia may cause hypocalcemia (from impaired PTH release) and hypokalemia (from renal wasting of potassium). Note that this mechanism is separate from rhabdomyolysis.\n\nAnswer D: Hypophosphatemia is common in refeeding syndrome and malnourished patients (such as those with alcohol use disorder) and presents with diffuse muscle weakness. Rather, hyperphosphatemia would be seen in rhabdomyolysis as it is released from damaged muscle cells.\n\nAnswer E: Red blood cells on urine microscopy would be seen in a nephritic syndrome in addition to red blood cell casts. Note that the urine dipstick will be positive for red blood cells in rhabdomyolysis due to cross-reactivity with myoglobin; however, there are minimal/no red blood cells actually present.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFrostbite can result in rhabdomyolysis which commonly causes hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common derangement).",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 23-year-old man found non-responsive after hiking in Alaska, with a very low body temperature of 91\u00b0F, which is hypothermia. His vital signs show a low heart rate (60), slow respirations (11), but blood pressure is within normal range. Oxygen saturation is good at 97% on room air. They're warming him with a warm air circulator and warm water on his extremities. The ECG is mentioned but we can't see it. The key point here is the presence of dark bullae on his extremities. His mental status improved with warming.\n\nThe question is asking which lab result is most likely to be found. The options are elevated troponin, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, or red blood cells in urine.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the complications of hypothermia. Hypothermia can lead to various issues. The dark bullae might be frostbite, which is tissue damage from freezing. Frostbite can lead to tissue necrosis, and when the tissue is rewarmed, there can be a release of myoglobin from damaged muscle cells. Myoglobin is a protein in muscle, and when released in large amounts, it can cause myoglobinuria, which is the presence of myoglobin in the urine. Myoglobinuria would show up as red blood cells on urine microscopy, but actually, myoglobin isn't a red blood cell, but it can cause the urine to look dark (like cola-colored). However, the presence of myoglobin might not always show RBCs on microscopy, but sometimes it can lead to hemoglobinuria if there's actual RBC damage. Wait, maybe the dark bullae are a sign of severe frostbite, leading to tissue death, and when warmed, the cells release their contents, including myoglobin. So the urine might have myoglobin, which would be detected as positive for blood on a dipstick (since myoglobin can cause a false positive for blood), but under microscopy, maybe RBCs aren't present. Hmm, but the option here is \"red blood cells on urine microscopy\". Alternatively, maybe the frostbite caused some actual tissue breakdown with RBC leakage?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the other options. Hypothermia can cause metabolic changes. Let's think about electrolytes. Hypocalcemia can occur in hypothermia, but I'm not sure. Wait,",

Specific physical exam findings that can suggest the diagnosis include meningeal signs such as a positive Kernig sign (inability to extend the knee while the hip is flexed) and Brudzinski sign (flexion of the neck results in flexion of lower extremities). Common causative agents include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. The latter of which is associated with the purpuric rash seen in this patient. The best initial step in management is a lumbar puncture followed promptly by IV broad spectrum antibiotics. Once the diagnosis/infectious agent is confirmed, the antibiotic agents can be refined. Other early steps in management include early blood cultures and fluid resuscitation. Steroids should be given in the setting of suspected Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome and concern for adrenal failure.\n\nLinder et. al review meningococcal meningitis.

This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome. They recommend aspirin and catheterization in an acute STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an initial ECG with ST depression (blue arrows) followed by pseudonormalization of the ST segment (green arrows) and possibly hyperacute T waves (black arrows), which are concerning for ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac catheterization may be required in this patient; however, if the patient\u2019s chest pain improves or if the troponin is negative, it is unlikely he is having an acute myocardial infarction requiring immediate catheterization. Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.",

Patients with persistent albuminuria despite both ACE/ARB and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy should be started on the nonsteroidal selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone.\n\nBakris et al. study the efficacy of finerenone, a nonsteroidal selective MRA, in the treatment of patients with albuminuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes. The authors found in a randomized control trial that finerenone reduced the incidence of a composite outcome of kidney failure. The authors recommend the use of finerenone in patients with persistent albuminuria despite optimal medical therapy to prevent risks of CKD progression and cardiovascular events.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Creatinine clearance changes over the time course of diabetic nephropathy and can be normal or elevated (due to glomerular hyperfiltration) in early diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, it is an unreliable test for early diabetic nephropathy compared to the more sensitive urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.\n\nAnswer B: Hemoglobin A1c is a test that reflects the average blood glucose over the past 2 to 3 months. While this test provides information on a patient's glycemic control, it does not directly assess the presence or extent of diabetic nephropathy.\n\nAnswer C: Oral glucose tolerance test is the test of choice for diagnosing gestational diabetes. It does not play a role in the detection of diabetic nephropathy.\n\nAnswer E: Urine protein dipstick is a useful test to detect proteinuria. This test is insensitive to low levels of albumin. Therefore, it is considered an inferior test to urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio testing is the most sensitive test to detect moderately elevated levels of urinary albumin excretion, a known byproduct of diabetic nephropathy.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 47-year-old woman with increased thirst and urination for three weeks. Her history includes obesity, hypertension, and depression, taking losartan and sertraline. She's a heavy smoker. The labs show a glucose of 215 mg/dL, which is elevated. The question is about the most appropriate screening test for nephropathy here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what tests are used to screen for nephropathy. Nephropathy, especially in the context of diabetes, often involves checking for albumin in the urine. Since the patient has high blood glucose, maybe she has undiagnosed diabetes, which is a common cause of nephropathy. The options given include urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (D) and urine protein dipstick (E). \n\nThe Oral glucose tolerance test (C) would be for diagnosing diabetes if the fasting wasn't enough, but her current glucose is already high. Hemoglobin A1c (B) would give an average over the past few months. But the question is about nephropathy screening. \n\nCreatinine clearance (A) measures kidney function but isn't a direct screening for nephropathy. The key here is that microalbuminuria is the early sign of kidney damage, especially in diabetics. Since her glucose is elevated, even if she's not diagnosed, screening for albumin in urine is standard. The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is more sensitive than a dipstick for detecting microalbuminuria. The dipstick is usually for proteinuria, which is more advanced. So the best answer should be D.\n</think>\n\nD",

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent. However, it is highly effective in patients who have failed other first-line agents and should still be used in appropriate candidates.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSNRIs are appropriate first-line agents for major depressive disorder in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

He's also reporting new pain in his legs. His medical history includes obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. The physical exam shows reduced sensation and \"electric\" pain in the legs, which might be neuropathic pain given his PVD and diabetes.\n\nFirst, the primary diagnosis here seems to be depression, given the symptoms like anhedonia (not enjoying activities), weight gain, sleep changes, guilt, and impaired work function. The onset after his wife's death points to a situational trigger. The request for oxycodone for leg pain could be related to his neuropathy, but the question is about the most appropriate treatment, which likely refers to the depression.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nAmitriptyline (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant. It's sometimes used for neuropathic pain because of its anticholinergic and membrane-stabilizing effects. Since he has both depression and neuropathic pain, this might be a good choice as it can address both issues.\n\nBupropion (B) is an antidepressant that's a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It's not typically first-line for neuropathic pain, and it doesn't help with pain. Plus, he might need something that also helps with pain.\n\nEscitalopram (C) is an SSRI. It's good for depression but not usually first-line for neuropathic pain. SSRIs can sometimes cause gastrointestinal side effects, which might be a concern with his diabetes and other conditions, but not sure.\n\nPhenelzine (D) is a MAOI, which is a older antidepressant. It has significant dietary restrictions and interactions, so it's usually reserved for treatment-resistant cases. Given his other medical issues, this might not be the first choice.\n\nVenlafaxine (E) is an SNRI. SNRIs like duloxetine are often used for neuropathic pain, but venlafaxine might also have some effect. However, venlafaxine can increase blood pressure, and he already has hypertension. His BP is currently controlled (129/82), but since his hypertension is poorly controlled, maybe venlafaxine's BP effects are a concern",

        "reason": "This patient presenting with cramping abdominal pain and frequent watery diarrhea a few weeks after finishing a course of antibiotics most likely has Clostridioides difficile infection, for which the most appropriate confirmatory test is a stool toxin assay.\n\nC. difficile infection should be suspected in patients with acute and clinically significant diarrhea with no obvious alternative explanation. It is associated with risk factors such as recent antibiotic use, hospitalization, and advanced age. Diagnosis is established via a positive enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxins and C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), or a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for C. difficile toxins. The GDH enzyme immunoassay is highly sensitive for detecting C. difficile, but not specific for toxin-producing C. difficile, and thus the toxin enzyme immunoassay is submitted in conjunction. If the results of both are discordant, then NAAT is used to make the diagnosis. Treatment for C. difficile infection differs by disease severity and recurrence. Commonly used medications include fidaxomicin and oral vancomycin.\n\nMcDonald et al. review the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of C. difficile and provide the algorithm for C. difficile testing as mentioned above. The authors also note that only liquid stool from patients with clinically significant and acute diarrhea should be submitted for testing. The authors recommend that formed stool from asymptomatic patients should not be tested because the presence of the C. difficile toxin gene does not distinguish between infection and asymptomatic carriage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal radiograph is an appropriate adjunctive diagnostic tool in patients with severe disease (e.g., severe abdominal pain and distension, fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis, marked leukocytosis) or fulminant colitis (marked by hypotension and ileus) to evaluate for toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings that warrant surgical intervention. In patients who are stable with low concern for severe disease or fulminant colitis, it would not be the preferred initial test for diagnosis nor would it be confirmatory.\n\nAnswer B: CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast is the preferred modality for detecting the presence of toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings that warrant surgical intervention in the setting of C. difficile colitis. Colonic dilatation of > 7 cm in diameter in the clinical setting of severe C. difficile infection is diagnostic. Other findings may include small bowel dilatation or scalloping of the bowel wall due to submucosal edema. While it would be reasonable to perform a CT scan in this patient, it would not confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAnswer C: Flexible sigmoidoscopy would be appropriate for cases in which an alternative diagnosis is suspected that requires direct visualization and/or biopsy of the bowel mucosa. It may also be helpful for patients with ileus or colitis in the absence of diarrhea as it allows for visualization of pseudomembranes on the inflamed mucosal surface, which are highly suggestive of C. difficile infection. In general, colonoscopy is a preferred and more accurate test.\n\nAnswer D: Rectal swab for selective anaerobic culture involves culture on a selective medium with toxin testing of isolated C. difficile. It is a highly sensitive test, but culture cannot distinguish toxin-producing strains from non-toxin-producing strains. A second test is required to detect toxin production by the cultured C. difficile strain (either enzyme immunoassay or nucleic acid amplification testing). Culture takes several days to finalize and as such, it is seldom used to establish a clinical diagnosis. It is most useful in patients with ileus and suspected C. difficile infection.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate confirmatory test for diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection is a stool toxin assay.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a variant of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) characterized by prominent irritability and disruption of everyday life.\n\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder is a variant of PMS characterized by recurrent physical and behavioral symptoms that manifest during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolve with menstruation. The diagnosis is made by criteria outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). To make a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, symptoms such as marked affective lability or marked irritability or anger must be present along with signs such as decreased concentration, hypersomnia or insomnia, and decreased interest in usual activities. These symptoms must cause significant distress or interfere with work, school, or relationships and must present 1 week before the onset of menses and resolve the week following menses. The initial management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder involves a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy and a menstrual diary to prospectively confirm symptoms and their relationship to the menstrual cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Following confirmation of a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, treatment involves lifestyle changes, antidepressant/anxiolytic medications, or hormonal therapies such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nBhatia et al. discuss premenstrual dysphoric disorder. They note that premenstrual dysphoric disorder affects 2-10% of women of reproductive age. They note that serotonin dysregulation may be relevant to the etiology and treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is anxiety characterized by symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, and irritability lasting > 6 months unrelated to any specific triggers. The topics of anxiety should be unrelated to one another.

These symptoms include sleep disturbance, anhedonia, guilt, loss of energy, loss of concentration, appetite/weight changes, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and suicidal ideation. Though this patient exhibits some of these symptoms, premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a more likely diagnosis as she exhibits these symptoms temporally related to her menstrual cycle.\n\nAnswer C: Panic disorder is characterized by 4 or more panic attacks (sweating, palpitations, shaking, paresthesias) in a 4-week period or \u2265 1 panic attack followed by at least 1 month of fear of another panic attack. Though this patient experiences anxiety that leads her to avoid her work, she does not have any of the characteristic signs of a panic attack and therefore does not meet the criteria for diagnosis of panic disorder.\n\nAnswer E: PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder have overlap in their symptoms; however, premenstrual dysphoric disorder is characterized by symptoms that significantly affect daily functioning.

It's common, affecting up to 80% of women, but it's usually mild. PMDD is a more severe form, with symptoms that significantly impair functioning. The DSM-5 criteria for PMDD include at least five symptoms, including mood swings, irritability, depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms like bloating. These symptoms must occur during the luteal phase (premenstrual) and resolve when menstruation starts. The symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social or work functioning.\n\nThe patient here has symptoms every four weeks (so monthly), which aligns with the menstrual cycle. The symptoms include mood swings, bloating, abdominal pain, interpersonal problems (arguments at work), difficulty concentrating, hypersomnia (sleeping longer), and anxiety. These are all classic PMDD symptoms. The key differentiator from PMS is the severity and the impact on her life\u2014she's taking time off work and has significant distress in relationships, which points more towards PMDD.\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) is chronic anxiety, not cyclical. Major depressive disorder would have more persistent symptoms, not tied to the menstrual cycle. Panic disorder involves panic attacks, which might not be mentioned here, though she has anxiety episodes.

Among the answer choices, mammography is the most appropriate diagnostic test to recommend.\n\nMammography is a screening tool for breast cancer that becomes most effective in postmenopausal patients because of less glandular breast tissue compared to younger patients. According to the United States Preventive Services Task Force, all women aged 50-74 should have mammograms every 1-2 years. It is controversial whether screening mammography should begin as early as age 40. Women with 1st-degree relatives with breast cancer should begin screening 10 years before the age of the family member's diagnosis.\n\nSeely and Alhassan review the evidence regarding the screening methods used for breast cancer. They discuss how screening every 1-2 years decreases breast cancer mortality. They recommend using judicious mixed modal methods of screening.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Routine chest radiography for lung cancer screening in low-risk patients is not recommended by the USPSTF. Chest imaging can be used to screen for lung cancer in patients with a significant smoking history.\n\nAnswer B: Colonoscopy for colon cancer screening is recommended every 10 years starting at age 50. This patient already had a colonoscopy 5 years ago so she does not need another exam at this time.\n\nAnswer D: Pelvic ultrasound for ovarian cancer screening is not currently recommended by the USPSTF.

        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 65-year-old woman who's coming back to her doctor after losing insurance. She hasn't had regular check-ups. Let's go through the details given.\n\nFirst, her lifestyle: she exercises 3-4 times a week, which is good, and eats red meat sparingly. She used to drink and smoke socially but not at home or on vacation. That might mean her alcohol and tobacco use wasn't heavy, but still, smoking even socially can have risks. \n\nHer main symptom is waking up with achy wrists and elbows, which she thinks is from using a computer keyboard over the years. That makes me think of something like carpal tunnel syndrome or maybe osteoarthritis, but the question is about the diagnostic test needed now. \n\nFamily history is important here. On her father's side, there's coronary artery disease, and on her mother's, colon cancer. She had a colonoscopy 5 years ago which was normal. Since she's 65, colon cancer screening guidelines usually recommend a colonoscopy every 10 years if the previous was normal and no other risk factors. But her family history on her mother's side has colon cancer. Wait, family history of colon cancer, especially first-degree relative, might change the screening interval. The NCCN guidelines say if you have a first-degree relative with colon cancer, you should start screening 10 years before the relative's diagnosis age. But the question doesn't specify the age of the relative's diagnosis. However, since she's 65, and the last colonoscopy was 5 years ago (at 60), maybe she's due for another one now? Let me think. If the relative had it at, say, 60, then she should start at 50. But since she's 65, even with family history, if her last was at 60, maybe it's time again. But the standard interval after a normal colonoscopy is 10 years unless there are polyps. Since her last was 5 years ago and normal, maybe she doesn't need it yet. Hmm, but the options include colonoscopy as B. \n\nOther parts: she's postmenopausal at 52. Menopause at 52 is normal, but maybe relevant for other tests like bone density, but that's not an option here. Her vital signs are all within normal",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 27-year-old man with altered mental status after running a marathon. He has a history of seizures. His temperature is really high (105\u00b0F), which is a key point. His vital signs show tachycardia and tachypnea. He had a tonic-clonic seizure, and they mention he's moving all four extremities and protecting his airway. They gave him IV fluids, and the urine dip has red blood cells.\n\nThe question is about which lab result is most likely. The options are hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, or hyponatremia.\n\nFirst, the scenario sounds like heat stroke because of the extremely high temperature and the context of marathon running. Heat stroke can lead to rhabdomyolysis because of the muscle breakdown from the heat. Rhabdo releases myoglobin into the blood, which can cause kidney damage and the presence of red blood cells in urine (though the dipstick here shows RBCs, maybe from myoglobinuria? Or actual RBCs? Not sure, but rhabdo is a consideration here.)\n\nNow, rhabdomyolysis releases a lot of muscle contents into the bloodstream. The key electrolyte issues here would be things like potassium, phosphorus, and myoglobin. When muscles break down, they release potassium and phosphate. So, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia are possible. Also, myoglobin can lead to increased uric acid, but hyperuricemia is also a possibility. Wait, but the options are A to E. Let's think step by step.\n\nIn heat stroke, the main issues are hyperthermia, which can cause muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). Rhabdomyolysis leads to release of muscle contents: potassium, phosphate, myoglobin, and creatine kinase. So, hyperkalemia (A) and hyperphosphatemia (B) would be expected. Also, when cells break down, phosphate is released, which can lower calcium (since phosphate and calcium levels are inversely related), so maybe hypocalcemia (D) could occur. But which is more likely?\n\nAdditionally, the patient had a seizure. Seizures can be caused by electrolyte imbalances. But the patient's history includes a seizure disorder, so maybe that's part of his baseline. However, the current episode might",

The most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of intestinal malrotation is an upper gastrointestinal series.\n\nMalrotation classically presents with bilious vomiting due to the formation of midgut volvulus. These patients will have normal development until the development of the obstruction followed by inability to feed and abdominal distention. Findings of malrotation on an upper gastrointestinal series include an abnormally placed ligament of Treitz on the right side of the abdomen and a \"corkscrew\" appearance of the distal duodenum. If an upper gastrointestinal contrast series confirms the diagnosis, patients should undergo surgery to reduce the volvulus in order to avoid intestinal perforation or other complications.\n\nAdams and Stanton review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal bowel obstruction. They discuss how malrotation, jejunoileal atresia, duodenal atresia, and colonic atresia are common causes of this finding.

This is consistent with intestinal malrotation complicated by midgut volvulus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Although abdominal CT would detect intestinal malrotation, CT should be avoided in the pediatric population in light of the radiation exposure. A CT scan with oral contrast can be useful in the adult setting in order to determine if there is extravasation of fluid from the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nAnswer B: Abdominal ultrasound is the test of choice for diagnosing pyloric stenosis, which presents with non-bilious vomiting and a palpable olive mass in the abdomen. Treatment of this condition is with surgical release of the stenotic pyloric muscle.\n\nAnswer C: A contrast enema is used to differentiate between Hirschsprung disease and meconium ileus but would not be helpful in diagnosing malrotation as the midgut volvulus occurs in the small intestine. Both Hirschsprung disease and meconium ileus present in neonatal patients with bilious vomiting and failure to pass meconium in the first 48 hours of life. Treatment is with excision of the defective segment or removal of the meconium respectively.\n\nAnswer D: Rectal suction biopsy is the most accurate test to diagnose Hirschsprung disease.

The key points here are the age, the symptoms, and the physical exam findings.\n\nFirst, the green vomitus is bile, which suggests that the obstruction is below the pylorus. Since he's an infant, common causes of intestinal obstruction in this age group come to mind. The most classic one is intestinal malrotation with midgut volvulus. That's a surgical emergency. The abdominal X-ray mentioned (Figure A) might show signs like the double bubble sign (which is more common in duodenal obstruction) or pneumatosis intestinalis, but since the question doesn't show the image, we have to go by the description.\n\nThe physical exam shows a soft but distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds. Midgut volvulus can present with these findings. The next step in diagnosis for suspected malrotation is typically an upper GI contrast study (like a barium swallow) to look for the \"double bubble\" sign, which represents dilation of the stomach and duodenum. However, if there's a suspicion of volvulus, some might proceed directly to a contrast enema to check for the \"coffee ground\" sign on the enema, which indicates midgut volvulus. Wait, but the options here are important. The options given are CT, ultrasound, contrast enema, rectal biopsy, or upper GI series.\n\nWait, the question says the abdominal radiograph was done (Figure A), but we don't have the image. The standard approach for suspected malrotation is an upper GI series. However, in an acute setting with possible volvulus, a contrast enema might be used because it can sometimes reduce the volvulus if done quickly. Alternatively, in some protocols, an upper GI is the first step. But given that the patient is in distress and the symptoms are acute, maybe contrast enema is the next step here. Let me think again.\n\nMidgut volvulus is a surgical emergency. The classic imaging is upper GI showing the double bubble. But if the upper GI isn't available immediately, or if there's a need to confirm the diagnosis quickly, a contrast enema can show the \"coffee ground\" appearance due to the twisted vessels. The contrast enema can also sometimes be therapeutic by reducing the volvulus. So in an emergency setting, contrast enema (option C) might",

This site is particularly prone to fracture due to the thin bone separating the coronoid and olecranon fossae in the supracondylar region. Due to the proximity of the brachial artery and median nerve, which course anteriorly, these structures are at risk for injury. Neurapraxia of the anterior interosseous nerve, which is a pure motor branch of the median nerve, presents as motor deficits in interphalangeal (IP) joint flexion of the thumb and distal IP joint flexion of the index finger. The radial and ulnar arteries are terminal branches of the brachial artery, which if injured results in diminished distal pulses. The diagnosis is made with anteroposterior and lateral view elbow radiographs. Radiographs will demonstrate the \"fat pad sign\" seen as a posterior fat pad that is indicative of fracture. Management depends on fracture type but can consist of cast immobilization (if minimally displaced with no neurovascular injury) or closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (for more displaced fractures).\n\nMicheloni et al. reviews supracondylar fractures in children. They note it is the most common elbow fracture in the pediatric population. They recommend early and correct diagnosis and management to avoid early and late complications including neurovascular impairment and malunion.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Both bone forearm fracture is another common pediatric fracture sustained from a fall, involving both the radius and ulna. It can be associated with neurovascular injury depending on the plane of deformity, but the location of the pain would be in the forearm, not proximal to the elbow.\n\nAnswer B: Distal radius fracture is a common fracture after a fall on an outstretched hand mechanism of injury. Neurovascular injury is possible, though uncommon. This patient\u2019s pain is localized around his elbow, rather than near the distal radius. Often, a deformity can be visualized on exam.\n\nAnswer C: Monteggia fracture-dislocation is characterized by a proximal ulna fracture with radial head dislocation. It is commonly caused by direct trauma to the ulna. In contrast, this patient\u2019s radial head is located inferior to the lateral epicondyle.\n\nAnswer D: Olecranon fracture is an uncommon pediatric fracture caused primarily by a fall onto the elbow in flexion.

He's refusing to move the elbow and is holding his wrist with the other hand. The key points here are the mechanism of injury and the physical exam findings.\n\nFirst, the mechanism: falling on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) is classic for certain elbow injuries. The immediate clutching of the elbow and refusal to move it suggests a possible fracture or dislocation. The exam findings are important here. The question mentions that the radial head is palpated just distal to the lateral epicondyle. Normally, the radial head is proximal to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. If it's distal, that means the radial head is dislocated. \n\nThen there's the mention of the diminished radial pulse. A diminished pulse could indicate compartment syndrome or vascular injury, but in the context of an elbow injury, it might point to a fracture that's affecting the brachial artery, which runs along the anterior aspect of the elbow. However, the key here is the position of the radial head. \n\nThe inability to make a pincer grasp and dropping the pen between thumb and index finger suggests loss of function, which could be due to nerve injury (like the radial nerve) or pain. But the radial nerve is more commonly injured in fractures around the humerus, like a supracondylar fracture. However, the radial head position is the big clue here.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Both bone forearm fracture: This involves both the radius and ulna. But the radial head being displaced distally might not specifically point to this unless there's a specific fracture here. But I need to think more.\n\nB) Distal radius fracture (like a Colles' fracture) typically occurs in adults, but in kids, it's possible. However, the radial head position here is key. In a distal radius fracture, the radial head might not be displaced in that way.\n\nC) Monteggia fracture-dislocation: This is a fracture of the ulna with dislocation of the radial head. That fits because the radial head is displaced distal to the lateral epicondyle. The ulna fracture would be proximal. The Monteggia injury is a combination of ulnar shaft fracture and radial head dislocation. The diminished pulse might be due to the fracture affecting the brachial artery, but that's a",

First-line primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation involves long term anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as rivaroxaban.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is caused by uncoordinated atrial contractions, typically due to atrial enlargement, inflammation, or infiltrative disease. Atrial fibrillation can lead to the formation of a thrombus, typically in the left atrial appendage, which can embolize to the brain and lead to an ischemic stroke. For this reason, there is a low threshold to start patients on long term anticoagulation for both primary and secondary stroke prevention (risk stratification is done with the CHA2DS2-VASc score, which considers several cardiovascular risk factors, age, sex, and diabetes). First-line long term anticoagulation is a DOAC medication such as apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban. Delayed initiation of anticoagulation is recommended at 4-14 days after a stroke, due to the interim risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Further management of atrial fibrillation includes a rate control agent such as a beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker.\n\nJS Alpert reviews the latest American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines regarding atrial fibrillation. The article reports that for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, DOACs are first-line compared to warfarin due to a decreased risk for bleeding with DOACs. In patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, warfarin is the preferred agent.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows an ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm (highlighted by the spacing of blue arrows) and no discernable P waves before QRS complexes, which is characteristic of atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aspirin exerts antiplatelet adhesion effects through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Patients with atrial fibrillation who are at low risk for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score of < 1) can use aspirin monotherapy for stroke prophylaxis. This patient presented after a stroke and will require long term anticoagulation, not anti-platelet monotherapy for stroke prevention.\n\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, which works to lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increase HDL cholesterol. It is most useful in secondary stroke prevention in patients who have suffered a thrombotic or thromboembolic stroke secondary to atherosclerosis. This patient may have atherosclerosis and could benefit from statin therapy; however, anticoagulation for his underlying atrial fibrillation is the highest priority.\n\nAnswer C: A cardiac pacemaker is indicated in a large variety of cardiac conditions that primarily involve sinus node dysfunction or high-grade atrioventricular block. Atrial fibrillation does not typically require a pacemaker, as it is typically managed with rate control agents such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or with electrical cardioversion. Rate control will not lower the stroke risk, and thus long-term anticoagulation is required.\n\nAnswer E: Warfarin has historically been a mainstay anticoagulant for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. DOACs are non-inferior to warfarin, and have a lower risk of bleeding. Note, only the initiation of warfarin requires a heparin bridge to mitigate the transient protein C deficiency that results in a temporary hypercoagulable state (often presenting as warfarin skin necrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients who present with an ischemic stroke secondary to a cardiac embolus from atrial fibrillation, first-line long term anticoagulation is a direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban).",

Wait, the question says \"an ECG is performed, as shown in Figure A.\" Since I can't see the figure, maybe the answer hinges on other clues. The patient's pulse is 130/min. A high heart rate could be due to various things, but if the ECG showed something like atrial fibrillation, that would point to a cardioembolic source. However, atrial fibrillation often causes irregularly irregular rhythm. Alternatively, if there's a slow heart rate, maybe a pacemaker is needed, but his pulse is 130, which is fast. \n\nWait, the options include a cardiac pacemaker (C). Pacemakers are for bradycardia or conduction issues. Since his pulse is 130, that's tachycardia, so maybe not a pacemaker. Unless the ECG showed a block that's causing intermittent bradycardia, but the question doesn't specify. Hmm.\n\nThe CT shows ischemia in the right MCA territory. The most common cause of ischemic stroke is atherosclerosis, but given the sudden onset and the location, could it be embolic? If the ECG shows atrial fibrillation, then the source might be a cardiac embolus, requiring anticoagulation. Since the patient was given alteplase (tPA), which is a thrombolytic, that's for acute treatment. \n\nThe options for secondary prevention: Aspirin (A) is an antiplatelet, used for atherosclerotic strokes. Warfarin (E) or Rivaroxaban (D) are anticoagulants, used for cardioembolic sources like atrial fibrillation. Atorvastatin (B) is a statin for cholesterol management, which is generally recommended for all stroke",

        "reason": "This healthy pediatric patient is presenting with cardiac arrest and an ECG demonstrating a short QT segment. Short QT syndrome is lethal and can lead to cardiac arrest in young, otherwise healthy patients.\n\nShort QT syndrome is an inherited condition that is caused by ion channel mutations (the most common identified mutation is a mutation in the cardiac myocyte potassium channel). There is no strict criteria for short QT syndrome, but the QT segment is often < 320 ms. Patients are usually young and healthy, and it is very common for the first presentation of this disease to be syncope or sudden cardiac death. ECG features suggestive of this condition include a short QT interval (without a clearly defined value but often < 360 ms) that is fixed (does not change with exercise or rest), peaked T waves, short or even absent ST segments, and episodes of atrial fibrillation or ventricular fibrillation in a patient in whom this would not be expected (such as a young patient). The only effective intervention is the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\nBjerregaard and Gussak discuss short QT syndrome. They note it is a heritable condition of the conduction system of the heart that can lead to lethal dysrhythmias. They discuss the management of this condition and recommend an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating a short QT segment (red arrow). Note the T waves appear peaked which can be seen in this syndrome. This may suggest hyperkalemia, but this patient\u2019s labs were normal at his appointment when the ECG was taken.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Complete heart block is more common in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome and presents with regular P-P and R-R intervals with complete P-R dissociation. It may cause syncope but is not associated with short QT syndrome. Management involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nAnswer C: Torsades des pointes is associated with a prolonged QT segment that progresses to the classic twisting of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric baseline. It can lead to cardiac arrest and requires immediate cessation of QT-prolonging medications and administration of magnesium. Note that this patient\u2019s QT segment is short rather than long.\n\nAnswer D: Ventricular fibrillation presents with disorganized electrical activity with no discernible rhythm. While this patient may have arrested from ventricular fibrillation, the most likely underlying etiology for his cardiac arrest given his age, ECG, and risk factors is an underlying condition such as short QT syndrome. For this reason, short QT syndrome is a better answer.\n\nAnswer E: Ventricular tachycardia could also occur in short QT syndrome and may have caused this patient\u2019s cardiac arrest. It presents with a monomorphic wide complex tachycardia that may cause arrest. Unstable patients require cardioversion while pulseless patients require defibrillation. Note that if this patient arrested from ventricular tachycardia, it was likely secondary to short QT syndrome.\n\nBullet Summary:\nShort QT syndrome is a rare but possible diagnosis in young, healthy patients who present with recurrent syncope or cardiac arrest.",

The autopsy didn't show any clear abnormalities, and his recent lab tests were normal. The key here is the previous ECG shown in Figure A, which I can't see, but the options suggest arrhythmias related to cardiac channelopathies or conduction issues.\n\nThe options are: Complete heart block, Short QT syndrome, Torsades de pointes, Ventricular fibrillation, or Ventricular tachycardia. \n\nFirst, complete heart block (A) usually causes bradycardia and may lead to syncope but not typically sudden cardiac arrest in a young, otherwise healthy person unless there's a severe block. But without ECG signs like a prolonged PR interval or dropped beats, maybe not the top choice here.\n\nShort QT syndrome (B) is a genetic condition where the QT interval is abnormally short. This can lead to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Since the previous ECG might show a short QT, this could be a candidate. \n\nTorsades de pointes (C) is a specific type of polymorphic VT often associated with long QT syndrome or drug effects. But if the QT was short, maybe not. Also, torsades usually has a torsading pattern on ECG, but the underlying cause here might be different.\n\nVentricular fibrillation (D) is a chaotic rhythm leading to cardiac arrest. It's a common cause, but the question mentions the previous ECG. If the ECG showed something that predisposes to VF, like a structural heart issue, but the autopsy was normal. Maybe the underlying cause is a channelopathy like Short QT.\n\nVentricular tachycardia (E) can be sustained and lead to arrest, but again, the ECG from before might show signs. If the previous ECG had a short QT interval, then Short QT syndrome (B) is a possible cause of sudden death due to arrhythmia. \n\nSince the autopsy was normal and labs were okay, structural heart issues are less likely. So a channelopathy like Short QT syndrome (B) would fit. The key is the ECG finding. Since the question mentions the previous ECG is in Figure A, and if that ECG shows a short QT interval, then B is the answer. The other options like VF or VT are arrhythmias that could be",

A common paraneoplastic syndrome in small cell lung cancer is Lambert-Eaton syndrome which presents with muscle weakness that improves with activity and worsens with rest.

This occurs secondary to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels which decrease acetylcholine release. The diagnosis of Lambert Eaton syndrome can be confirmed with electromyography.

The patient is a 72-year-old man with weakness, weight loss, chronic cough, and a significant smoking and alcohol history. His vital signs show hypertension, a slightly elevated temperature, and low oxygen saturation. The chest X-ray is mentioned but we can't see it. The question is asking which test would best determine the cause of his weakness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible causes of his symptoms. The chronic cough and smoking history make me think of lung issues like COPD, lung cancer, or maybe interstitial lung disease. The weight loss and chronic illness could point towards malignancy. The weakness could be due to several factors here. Let's look at the options.\n\nOption A is blood tests. Blood work can check for anemia, electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid issues, or inflammation. Since he's losing weight and has a chronic cough, maybe something like anemia of chronic disease, or even hypercalcemia from a tumor. But would that directly explain the weakness? Maybe, but perhaps not the most specific.\n\nOption B is a CT scan of the chest. Since he has a chronic cough and a chest X-ray was done but maybe the CT would give more detail. CT is better for detecting lung lesions, tumors, emphysema, or other structural issues. Given his smoking history, a CT could pick up something like lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The weakness might be due to underlying lung disease leading to hypoxia, which is supported by his low oxygen saturation. So a CT might show the cause of his respiratory issues, which in turn could explain the weakness.\n\nOption C is electromyography (EMG). That's for neuromuscular issues. If the weakness was due to a nerve or muscle disorder like myopathy or neuropathy, then EMG would be useful. But given his other symptoms (cough, weight loss, smoking), maybe that's less likely unless there's a neuromuscular disease complicating things. But the question is about the most likely test to elucidate the cause. Since his symptoms are more respiratory and systemic, maybe EMG is not the first choice.\n\nOption D is lung biopsy. That's invasive and usually done after imaging shows a lesion. Since the chest X-ray is already done, maybe a CT would be needed first before a biopsy. So maybe not the first step.\n\nOption E is muscle biopsy. That's for muscle",

The first step in management of patients with blunt trauma and hemodynamic instability is a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST exam)\n\nFor any patient with blunt or penetrating trauma, the first step in management is an evaluation of airway, breathing, and circulation. This is referred to as the primary survey and includes the verification of endotracheal tube placement, auscultation of bilateral breath sounds, and assessment of external wounds or bleeding. This is followed by the secondary survey which involves a detailed head to toe inspection for injuries. Blunt abdominal trauma with bruising as well as hemodynamic instability warrants a FAST exam. The FAST exam visualizes the heart chambers and pericardium, left upper quadrant (spleen, splenorenal recess), right upper quadrant (Morrison pouch) and the rectovesical (males) or rectouterine (females) pouch. The extended FAST exam (eFAST) includes an examination of the lungs as well to assess for pneumothorax or hemothorax. Hemodynamically unstable patients with free fluid identified in the abdomen on initial FAST exam should proceed directly to the operating room for emergent surgical intervention with ongoing volume resuscitation. Patients with hemodynamic instability and a negative FAST exam should be evaluated for sources of bleeding elsewhere such as the pelvis.\n\nBarloon et al. review diagnostic imaging in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma is a common cause of death and injury, leading to hemodynamic instability. Intra-abdominal imaging is especially important in comatose or sedated (intubated) patients who are unable to provide a history or provide a reliable physical examination. In stable patients, CT of the abdomen often has a role in deciding whether to pursue observation versus surgical intervention.\n\nStengel et al. evaluate emergency ultrasound-based algorithms for diagnosing blunt abdominal trauma. The systematic review showed that ultrasound-based pathways reduced the number of CT scans obtained. Use of ultrasound can enhance the speed of the primary assessment and cut costs. However, the authors conclude that there is insufficient evidence to promote justification of ultrasound-based pathways for the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma in terms of patient outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: AP and lateral radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis may be useful for identifying pelvic fracture or intraperitoneal free air. However, this patient's presentation is suggestive of abdominal trauma warranting FAST exam.\n\nAnswer B: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast would be appropriate for evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma in a patient that is hemodynamically stable. However, this patient's vital signs indicate hemodynamic instability.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is no longer commonly used in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma.\n\nAnswer E: Norepinephrine infusion would not be appropriate for this patient with shock secondary to blood loss.

He's an ill-appearing patient with significant abdominal bruising but no external bleeding. The pelvis is stable. They started packed red blood cells.\n\nThe question is asking for the next best step in management. The options are imaging studies or procedures like FAST, DPL, CT, or norepinephrine.\n\nFirst, considering he's hypotensive and has abdominal trauma (bruising), we need to figure out the source of bleeding. In trauma, especially in the unstable patient, the FAST exam is usually the first-line imaging. FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) is quick and can detect free fluid in the abdomen, which might indicate internal bleeding. It's done at the bedside and doesn't require moving the patient, which is important in unstable patients.\n\nDiagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is another option, but it's less commonly used now since FAST is faster and just as effective. CT scans are more detailed but require moving the patient to the scanner, which might not be safe if he's unstable. The question mentions he's already getting blood, so he's likely in shock. The FAST exam can quickly assess for blood in the abdomen, guiding whether to take him to the OR. \n\nAnterior-posterior and lateral X-rays might show some things like fractures or pneumothorax, but not internal bleeding as effectively as FAST. Norepinephrine would be for managing blood pressure, but the underlying issue is likely ongoing bleeding, so you need to address that first.

Note the episodes of syncope in this condition are intermittent and specifically provoked and do not have lasting/permanent neurological deficits in contrast to a stroke.

The lactate may be elevated after a seizure, and the prolactin level is a more specific indicator of a seizure. However, the diagnosis is most appropriately made based on history, exam, and EEG.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke involving the vertebrobasilar system may cause syncope in addition to ongoing dizziness and vertigo with ataxia. However, this patient's symptoms seem to be positional and have entirely resolved; thus, a stroke is unlikely. He is at higher risk of stroke given his vertebrobasilar insufficiency and an MRI should still be performed in this patient.\n\nAnswer E: Vagal event presents with a warm prodrome with palpitations, flushing, and syncope. Muscle twitching (but no tonic-clonic activity) may be seen. Patients may wake up slightly confused but return to baseline within seconds.\n\nBullet Summary:\nVertebrobasilar insufficiency may present with positional episodes of syncope caused by insufficient blood flow through the vertebrobasilar blood vessels.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 67-year-old man with recurrent syncope. The key points here are the circumstances around his fainting episodes. He mentions that the syncope happens when he changes position from sitting to standing, exerts himself, or turns his head quickly. The symptoms before fainting include numbness, vertigo, and trouble speaking. After waking, he's confused but returns to normal quickly.\n\nHis medical history includes diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. These conditions can contribute to vascular issues. The physical exam is normal except when he stands and walks, leading to the same symptoms. The options given are blood vessel narrowing, cardiac dysrhythmia, seizure, stroke, or vagal event.\n\nFirst, let's consider each option. Cardiac dysrhythmia (B) could cause syncope, but the trigger here is positional changes and head movement, which makes me think more of a vascular issue. Seizures (C) might present with confusion, but the prodromal symptoms like vertigo and numbness are more neurological. Stroke (D) is a possibility, but recurrent episodes and quick recovery are less typical unless it's a TIA, but the triggers here don't align with typical TIA causes.\n\nVagal event (E) like vasovagal syncope can cause fainting, often with triggers like pain or emotional stress, but the positional changes and head turning are more specific. Blood vessel narrowing (A) might refer to something like vertebral artery stenosis. The vertebrobasilar system supplies the posterior part of the brain. If there's narrowing in the vertebral artery, certain head movements could compress the artery, leading to transient ischemia. Symptoms like vertigo, ataxia, numbness, and dysarthria (trouble speaking) are classic for vertebrobasilar insufficiency. The episodes are brief, lasting 1-5 minutes, which fits a TIA from that area. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of atherosclerosis, which can cause vessel narrowing. When he stands and walks, the movement might be causing the artery to be compressed or the plaque to reduce blood flow transiently.\n\nSo putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is blood vessel narrowing, specifically affecting the vertebral artery. The other options don't fit as well with the positional triggers and the symptoms described. Cardiac issues would more likely have different triggers, like exertion leading to",

Since the patient is young and healthy, oral hydration and rest are all that is needed for management.\n\nDiarrheal illness is a common chief complaint with variable workups pending on the patient's clinical status. Young, healthy, non-immunosuppressed patients who can tolerate an oral diet require only reassurance and oral hydration, as most cases of viral and bacterial diarrhea will resolve on their own. Moreover, most cases of diarrhea are caused by viral etiologies which simply require supportive therapy. This is even true in bacterial diarrhea as long as the patient's vitals normalize and they can tolerate an oral diet. It is important to consider inflammatory causes of diarrhea (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease) as this would change the workup and management.\n\nSchiller et al. discuss different types of diarrhea. They review the management and diagnosis of diarrhea and its different forms, including chronic forms. They recommend noting the difference between different causes and working up and treating them appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that can be used for bacterial/infectious diarrhea. It should not be given in young, healthy patients and would only be indicated in the setting of bacterial diarrhea in ill patients, patients with persistent symptoms, or patients who are immunosuppressed. Bacterial diarrhea would present with fever, abdominal pain, and bloody/purulent diarrhea.\n\nAnswer C: Stool culture should not be empirically performed in young, well-appearing patients. It may be performed in hospitalized patients who are more ill or in patients who are going to start antibiotic therapy. It may also be performed in patients with persistent diarrhea.\n\nAnswer D: A stool ova and parasite study would not be performed unless there was a suggestive history or exposure (such as drinking unfiltered water) in the setting of fatty, foul-smelling diarrhea. This would raise suspicion for Giardia lamblia which would be treated with metronidazole.\n\nAnswer E: Stool PCR for viral etiologies of diarrhea is not useful as the management of viral diarrhea is supportive therapy in most cases. On occasion, it may be performed in critically ill patients to determine the etiology of their symptoms. It should not be performed routinely.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHealthy patients with limited diarrheal illness require supportive therapy only (in particular, oral hydration) and do not need more invasive diagnostic tests.",

The options are antibiotics (Cipro), rest and oral rehydration, stool culture, ova/parasite, or stool PCR.\n\nFirst, the presentation is classic for acute watery diarrhea, likely infectious. Since he's young and otherwise healthy, maybe a bacterial or viral cause. The key here is that after rehydration, his vitals improved. So the immediate issue was dehydration, which they addressed. Now, the next step.\n\nThe options: Cipro is an antibiotic, which is used for certain bacterial infections like Shigella, Salmonella, or Campylobacter. But since the diarrhea is watery, not bloody, it might be a viral (like norovirus) or osmotic issue. However, sometimes bacterial can also present with watery diarrhea initially. But antibiotics aren't given empirically unless there's a suspicion of a specific pathogen that responds to cipro, like Shigella or maybe cholera in endemic areas. But the question doesn't mention travel or other risk factors.\n\nStool studies: Stool culture (C) would detect bacterial pathogens. Ova/parasite (D) checks for parasites like Giardia, Cryptosporidium. Stool PCR (E) is a newer test that can detect a wide range of pathogens via molecular methods. \n\nThe question is, after rehydration, what's next? Since he's responding to fluids, the acute phase is managed. Now, do we need to identify the pathogen? The options are between the stool tests and continuing rehydration. \n\nOption B is rest and oral rehydration. But he already got IV fluids and is now stable.

Toxic shock syndrome occurs most commonly due to infection with Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) occurs due to infection with Staphylococcal or Streptococcal species that produce \"super-antigen\" toxins, such as TSST-1 produced by S. aureus. These toxins bind directly to the MHC-II receptor on T cells with high affinity causing a massive, sustained cytokine release. The result is a \"cytokine storm\" causing an intense inflammatory reaction and distributive shock. These infections arise in the setting of a retained tampon or retained nasal packing following nasal surgery; however, this is not always the case. The clinical presentation of TSS is characterized by fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and a diffuse \"sunburn-like\" rash. Desquamation of the palms and soles typically occurs during recovery, 1-2 weeks after the acute phase of the illness. The initial management of TSS begins with broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Typical regimens include vancomycin, cefepime, and clindamycin. The initial antibiotic regimen should cover methicillin-resistant Staph aureus. Clindamycin is always included due to its ability to suppress bacterial protein production, therefore limiting the production of bacterial toxins. Once a causative organism is identified, antibiotic therapy may be narrowed, though clindamycin is usually administered for the duration of treatment.\n\nFigure A is the classic generalized and erythematous macular/desquamating rash of toxic shock syndrome.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer A: Borrelia burgdorferi is a spirochetal bacteria that causes Lyme disease.

Fever is common, although a purpuric rash and signs of meningeal irritation would be expected. Patients are often profoundly unstable.\n\nAnswer C: Rhinovirus is the viral pathogen most commonly responsible for the common cold that causes minor symptoms including a cough, runny nose, fever, and aches.\n\nAnswer D: Rickettsia rickettsii causes rocky mountain spotted fever which presents with a high fever, headache, malaise, and a centripetal maculopapular rash that starts on the extremities and migrates to the trunk.

An MRI may be useful in the diagnosis in patients whom are too painful to examine or who may have partial tears of the triceps tendon. Surgical repair is indicated in patients with complete rupture or in those with >50% tears and significant weakness.\n\nYeh et al. review distal triceps ruptures.

FOOSH is often associated with injuries like fractures (e.g., radial head fracture) or dislocations, but the pain here is posterior, so maybe something else.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Exacerbation of elbow arthritis: Arthritis usually causes chronic pain and stiffness, but this is an acute injury from a fall. Maybe not the first thought unless there's a history, but the question doesn't mention that.\n\nB) Triceps rupture: The triceps attaches to the olecranon.

But the pain is posterior. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the anatomy here. Alternatively, an avulsion of the olecranon? Wait, the options say Anconeus avulsion fracture.

Her current meds include levothyroxine, and her periods are regular. \n\nLooking at the labs: her calcium is 7.0 mEq/L. Wait, normal calcium is around 8.5-10.2, so that's low.

Low calcium can cause ECG changes like prolonged ST segment, T waves, etc. \n\nHer thyroidectomy might have led to hypoparathyroidism if the parathyroid glands were damaged. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium and phosphorus. If she's hypoparathyroid, PTH would be low, leading to low calcium (hypocalcemia) and high phosphorus (hyperphosphatemia). The symptoms of numbness (paresthesias) and possible eye issues like cataracts from hypocalcemia? Wait, but her pupils are opacified\u2014maybe nuclear cataracts, which can be a sign of hypocalcemia?

        "reason": "This patient presents with oligomenorrhea, hot flashes, and dyspareunia, and her labs are notable for a high FSH and low estradiol, most consistent with premature ovarian insufficiency/failure (POI). The most appropriate next step in management is an estradiol patch with oral medroxyprogesterone.\n\nPOI is defined by the depletion or dysfunction of ovarian follicles, resulting in oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea with symptoms of menopause (hot flashes, vaginal atrophy and dryness, mood swings, etc.) in women under age 40. The cause is unclear and thought to be autoimmune. The main diagnostic markers are a high FSH and low estradiol at the start of the follicular phase. Patients require estrogen supplementation until around age 50, as low estrogen increases the risk of coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, and sexual dysfunction. Vaginal gel or a transdermal patch is the first-line option, but both must be used in conjunction with medroxyprogesterone to avoid unopposed estrogen and the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.\n\nTsiligiannis et al. review the evidence regarding the outcomes of patients with POI. They discuss how this diagnosis is made in patients younger than the age of 40. They recommend closely managing the cardiovascular risk factors associated with this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Brain MRI would be useful for evaluating for the presence of a prolactinoma, which could cause the headaches and oligomenorrhea seen in this patient. However, her prolactin level is normal, and she has no visual disturbances (e.g., bitemporal hemianopsia), making this study less relevant.\n\nAnswer B: The combined oral contraceptive has both estrogen and progesterone, but the doses are higher than those needed for hormone replacement. For this reason, it is generally not considered first-line for the treatment of POI.\n\nAnswer D: Increasing this patient\u2019s levothyroxine dose is unnecessary, as her TSH level is within the normal range. Furthermore, while hypothyroidism may cause menstrual irregularities and temperature dysregulation, it is unlikely to cause vaginal dryness and subsequent dyspareunia.\n\nAnswer E: Vaginal estradiol gel is an effective method of estrogen replacement in women with POI. However, used alone it may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, so it should only be used in combination with a systemic progesterone.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPremature ovarian insufficiency should be treated with estrogen and progesterone replacement.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 35-year-old woman with irregular menstruation, only two periods in the last year. She's also experiencing flushing, dyspareunia, post-coital spotting, and more frequent headaches. Her medical history includes Hashimoto thyroiditis, on levothyroxine, and her mom has type 1 diabetes.\n\nFirst, looking at the labs. Her TSH is 28 \u00b5IU/mL, which is within the normal range given the reference (9-30). So her thyroid function might be okay, but since she's on levothyroxine, maybe her TSH is controlled. But the key here is the FSH and estradiol levels. On cycle day 3, FSH is 49, which is way above the normal upper limit of 21.5. Estradiol is 8, which is below the normal range (27-123). High FSH and low estradiol typically indicate menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. That makes sense with her amenorrhea and symptoms.\n\nNow, the question is the next step. The options are brain MRI, COC, estradiol with medroxyprogesterone, increase levothyroxine, or vaginal estradiol.\n\nThe headaches could be a red herring. But high FSH and low estradiol point to ovarian failure. So the main issue here is hypoestrogenic state from ovarian insufficiency. The symptoms like dyspareunia and post-coital spotting could be due to atrophic changes in the vagina from low estrogen.\n\nThe next step in management for someone with premature ovarian insufficiency would be hormone replacement therapy. Since she's symptomatic (amenorrhea, dyspareunia, etc.), starting estrogen plus progestin would be appropriate. Option C is estradiol patch with medroxyprogesterone, which provides both. Option E is vaginal gel, which might help local symptoms but not systemic estrogen deficiency. Option B (COC) could be used but in someone with ovarian failure, combined oral contraceptives might not be the first choice since they provide estrogen and progestin but are typically for contraception. However, in this case, the main issue is hormone replacement. Option D is increasing levothyroxine, but her TSH is already in the normal range, so that's probably not needed. Brain MRI would be for prol",

These patients will typically demonstrate the defense mechanism of splitting (seeing things as all good or all bad). Dialectical behavioral therapy can be used in order to help these patients mitigate self-injurious behaviors.\n\nAnswer B: Intermittent explosive disorder presents with sudden episodes of aggression out of proportion to the stressor. This patient\u2019s response is a result of his paranoia rather than an excessive response to reasonable stimuli. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be used in order to help these patients control their emotional outbursts.\n\nAnswer C: Narcissistic personality disorder presents with a grand sense of self-importance and preoccupation with success and admiration.

They are sometimes still used for depression and neuropathic pain. In overdose, TCAs block sodium channels in the heart and cause a pathognomonic QRS widening. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered until the QRS duration normalizes. TCAs also have anticholinergic properties and can cause an anticholinergic toxidrome including delirium, confusion, constipation, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, dry, warm, and flushed skin, and fever. Although physostigmine is typically the antidote of choice for an anticholinergic toxidrome, it is avoided in TCA toxicity due to the theoretical concern for inducing a cardiac arrest.\n\nUrquhart et al. studied the utility of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of chronic lower back pain.

The question is asking which finding is likely present at some point.\n\nFirst, considering lithium toxicity. Lithium overdose can cause symptoms like tremors, ataxia, confusion, seizures, and ECG changes like T wave abnormalities or arrhythmias. The ECG in Figure A might show something like a prolonged QT interval or others, but since I can't see it, maybe the key is in the options.\n\nLooking at the options: Diaphoresis (sweating), jaundice (yellow skin, liver issue?), miosis (constricted pupils), urinary retention, wheezing.\n\nLithium toxicity can present with neurologic symptoms like tremors, nystagmus, ataxia, and maybe increased reflexes. But the options here don't include those. Let's think about other possibilities. The patient has a pain specialist, so maybe she's on opioids for her back pain. Opioid overdose can cause miosis (pinpoint pupils), respiratory depression, hypotension, but her BP here is 102/78, which is okay. But if she took an overdose, maybe miosis would be present. However, the question mentions she was found with a suicide note, so maybe a combination of lithium and another drug?\n\nAlternatively, if it's lithium toxicity alone, what symptoms? Lithium can cause GI symptoms like nausea, vomiting, but also neuro issues. Diaphoresis might occur with toxicity. Wait, but miosis is more opioid-related. Urinary retention can be from opioids too. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ECG shows T wave changes, which are common in lithium toxicity. But the question is about another finding. Let's think of the options again. \n\nAnother angle: the patient's temperature is elevated (100.5\u00b0F), which could be due to hyperthyroidism (if lithium is causing that?), but more likely in toxicity, maybe due to neuroleptic malignant syndrome?

He drinks alcohol occasionally, doesn't smoke, and no family history of cancer.\n\nFirst, the key symptoms here are the chronic cough, weight loss, and dark stools. The cough is worse at night, which might suggest something like GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) because lying down can exacerbate reflux.

But the patient denies dysphagia, so maybe not the first choice. However, sometimes silent reflux can cause cough without obvious dysphagia.\n\nColonoscopy (B) is for lower GI issues, like colorectal cancer or bleeding in the colon. But dark stools are more indicative of upper GI bleeding. However, occult blood in the stool from the colon can also cause dark stools, though typically melena is upper, and bright red blood lower. But the question mentions darker stools, so maybe upper GI is more likely. Still, colonoscopy could be considered if lower GI is a possibility, but maybe not the first step here.\n\nH. pylori test (C) is for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection, which can cause peptic ulcers. If he has an ulcer, that could lead to bleeding (dark stools) and maybe GERD-related cough. But would we do a stool antigen test before endoscopy?

        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 4-day-old boy who was born at 36 weeks via cesarean due to cervical incompetence. He's being breastfed every 2 hours for 20-30 minutes. His weight dropped from 3670g to 3487g, which is about a 5% decrease. The main concern here is the jaundice noted in the eyes (icteric) and the bilirubin levels. The total bilirubin is 13 mg/dL, with conjugated (direct) bilirubin at 0.6. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the type of jaundice. The conjugated bilirubin is low, so it's likely unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is common in newborns, especially breastfed ones. The fact that he's breastfed and the bilirubin is 13 mg/dL at 4 days makes me think of breastfeeding-related jaundice. The weight loss is about 5%, which is within the expected range for breastfed infants, but maybe contributing to some degree.\n\nThe options given are: IV hydration, continue breastfeeding, serum uric acid, spot uric/creatinine, or increase breastfeeding frequency. \n\nUnconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a term baby (even though he was 36 weeks, which is close to term) is usually managed with ensuring adequate feeding. Since the baby is feeding every 2 hours and the stools are mustard-colored (which is typical for breastfed), maybe the issue is sufficient intake. The weight loss isn't too severe, but maybe increasing the frequency could help. However, the current breastfeeding seems adequate. \n\nOption B is to continue the current regimen, but the bilirubin is 13. The risk of hyperbilirubinemia in a 4-day-old needs to be assessed. The risk depends on gestational age, age, and bilirubin level. Using the Bhutani nomogram, a 4-day-old (postnatal day 4) with 13 mg/dL might be in the high-risk zone. But since he's 36 weeks, preterm infants have higher risk. Wait, 36 weeks is considered moderate to late preterm. The nomogram for preterm infants is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is pointing",

        "reason": "This patient presents with a nonreactive NST on routine testing. The most common explanation for a nonreactive NST is the fetal sleep cycle.\n\nPatients with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of fetal demise and other perinatal complications. They require closer monitoring during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The NST, which lasts 20 minutes, is the most common method of doing so. After 32 weeks, a reactive (i.e. \u201cnormal\u201d) NST requires at least 2 episodes of 15-beat-per-minute accelerations lasting for at least 15 seconds. An NST with no accelerations is considered nonreactive. A common cause of a nonreactive NST is the fetal sleep cycle and it is reasonable to continue the test for an additional 20 minutes to increase the chance of monitoring the fetus while awake. Otherwise, a nonreactive NST should prompt vibroacoustic stimulation or further testing such as a biophysical profile (BPP).\n\nUmana and Siccardi review the evidence regarding the use of the NST during pregnancy. They discuss how the test is a measurement of fetal cardiovascular function at the time of the test. They recommend monitoring the baseline fetal heart rate and variability as well as the presence of accelerations and decelerations when interpreting test results.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows a representative portion of a NST where the fetal heart rate remains within a narrow band without accelerations (red circle). This pattern is characteristically seen in a nonreactive NST that can be due to the fetal sleep cycle.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Maternal dehydration generally should not affect the reactivity of an NST. Although severe dehydration may reduce amniotic fluid volume and therefore increase the baseline fetal pulse, it is unlikely to change the accelerations or variability in an NST. Though this patient had diarrhea the day before, her pulse is not elevated and any dehydration is probably not clinically significant.\n\nAnswer C: Maternal medication use can cause nonreactivity on an NST if drugs such as morphine or other sedatives are taken. Although this patient did take loperamide (an opioid), it is unlikely that this has a sedative effect on the fetus as it acts selectively on the mu-opioid receptors in the large intestine and does not cross the blood-brain barrier.\n\nAnswer D: Maternal smoking in close proximity to an NST has been linked to nonreactivity, but this patient has not smoked in several months. Mothers who smoke are counseled to avoid smoking on the day of their NST to avoid the effects of nicotine on their test results.\n\nAnswer E: A normal result is known as a reactive NST and would present with accelerations and no concerning or late decelerations. This is not a reactive NST due to the lack of appropriate accelerations.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most common cause of a non-reactive non-stress test is the fetal sleep cycle.",

The question is asking for the most likely explanation for her NST results, but since we don't have the actual NST tracing (Figure A), I need to rely on the information given in the case to deduce the possible reason.\n\nFirst, let's go through her history. She had diarrhea and vomiting after a picnic two days ago. She took loperamide (Imodium) and got some relief. She's worried about dehydration but feels better now. She has gestational diabetes managed with insulin, migraines, GERD. She quit smoking at the start of her pregnancy. No alcohol or drugs.

NST can sometimes be non-reactive if the baby is sleeping. But the test is called non-stress test because it's looking for fetal heart rate reactivity. If the baby is asleep, they might not move as much, leading to a non-reactive test. However, usually, they try to wake the baby by rubbing the mother's belly or using sound to get a reactive test. Since the question doesn't mention if they tried to stimulate the baby, maybe this is a possibility. But the question is about the \"most likely\" explanation based on her history.\n\nOption B: Maternal dehydration. She had diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration. Dehydration can reduce uteroplacental perfusion, leading to decreased fetal oxygenation, which might cause a non-reactive NST. But she says she's feeling better and has recovered. However, even if she's better now, the effects of dehydration might have occurred earlier. But the NST is done now. If she's rehydrated now, maybe that's not the issue. But maybe the dehydration from before could have caused some effect. Not sure yet.\n\nOption C: Maternal medication use. She took loperamide. Loperamide is an opioid agonist.

The physical exam shows he's otherwise healthy, with normal vital signs, and he's dressed in all burlap.\n\nFirst, I need to differentiate between the different psychotic disorders and personality disorders listed here. The options are Brief Psychotic Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, and Schizotypal Personality Disorder.\n\nLet me recall the criteria for each. \n\nSchizophrenia is a chronic condition with symptoms lasting at least six months, including at least one month of active symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized behavior, or catatonia. The duration here is 8 months, which fits. But I need to check if the symptoms meet the criteria for schizophrenia.\n\nSchizophreniform disorder is similar but the duration is between one month and six months. Since this patient has had symptoms for 8 months, that's beyond the six-month mark, so it can't be schizophreniform. So option D is out.\n\nBrief Psychotic Disorder (A) has a duration of less than one month, so that's too short here. So A is not right.\n\nNow, the personality disorders: Schizoid (B) and Schizotypal (E). Personality disorders are long-standing patterns, usually starting in adolescence or early adulthood. Schizoid involves detachment from social relationships, restricted emotions, and limited close relationships. Schizotypal includes odd beliefs (like magical thinking, telepathy), suspiciousness, odd speech, and peculiar behavior. The patient here has the belief in telepathy with animals, which is an odd belief, and his dress (all burlap) might be odd. But personality disorders don't typically include hallucinations or delusions as prominent features, but more eccentric behavior and thinking. However, the key here is the duration of symptoms. The question states the symptoms have been present for 8 months. Personality disorders are about long-standing traits, not a recent onset of symptoms. The patient's symptoms (the telepathy issues) started 8 months ago, which might be a better fit for a psychotic disorder rather than a personality disorder. \n\nWait, but the question",

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration).

Flumazenil is for benzodiazepine overdose, which can cause similar symptoms but the pupils in benzodiazepine overdose are more likely to be normal or maybe a bit small but not pinpoint. Also, flumazenil can cause withdrawal, so if it's an opioid, using flumazenil wouldn't help and might be harmful if the patient is on benzodiazepines and opioids together. \n\nAtropine is for bradycardia or anticholinergic poisoning, but here the heart rate is 80, which is normal. Disulfiram is used for alcohol dependence as an aversive agent, not for acute management. Observation might be considered, but given the signs pointing to opioids, giving naloxone would be the immediate step. Even if the patient is arousable, the presence of miosis and decreased bowel sounds supports opioids. So the answer should be D, Naloxone.\n</think>\n\nD",

Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures. They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery. They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation. It would be inappropriate to only treat this patient symptomatically with a lateral anal fissure as this is a sign of a more serious diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnal fissures that are lateral to the midline require workup for sexually transmitted infections, cancer, and autoimmune disease.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 32-year-old man with pain during defecation, blood on toilet paper, and difficulty passing stools. He's been having these symptoms for a few weeks, and they're getting worse. The physical exam shows a small, superficial fissure lateral to the anus and midline. The options are about management.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on here. The key symptoms are pain with bowel movements and visible blood. The presence of an anal fissure is mentioned. Anal fissures are common, especially in people who strain during bowel movements. The description of the fissure being superficial and lateral makes me think it's an acute fissure rather than a chronic one. Since he's a software engineer, maybe he sits a lot, which could contribute, but he also hikes and dances, so maybe not. The location being lateral is important because most anal fissures are posterior or anterior, but lateral ones can occur too.\n\nThe question is about management. Let's look at the options. \n\nOption A is a CT scan. That's usually for more serious issues like diverticulitis, abscess, or cancer. But the patient's exam shows a fissure, so maybe not necessary here unless they suspect something else. But the question states the fissure is already found on exam, so maybe CT isn't needed.\n\nOption B is incision, drainage, antibiotics. That sounds like treatment for an abscess. But the fissure here is superficial, not an abscess. Unless there's an associated abscess, but the question doesn't mention a palpable mass or severe pain suggesting an abscess. So maybe B isn't right.\n\nOption C is surgical excision. That's more for chronic fissures that haven't healed with conservative treatment. Since this is a small, superficial, and recent fissure (symptoms started weeks ago), surgery is probably not the first step.\n\nOption D is testing for HIV, fecal occult blood, and STDs. The patient is generally healthy, doesn't smoke, and the fissure is likely due to straining. However, sometimes fissures can be a sign of underlying issues like HIV or inflammatory bowel disease. But the question doesn't give any red flags like weight loss, family history, or other symptoms. The patient is 32 and otherwise healthy. Maybe the STD testing is because he goes to nightclubs? But the fissure itself is more likely due to mechanical factors. Fecal",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

Now he's back with similar symptoms: fever, malaise, cough with blood, and new chest X-ray showing nodules in the left upper lobe and hilar adenopathy. His CD4 count had bounced back to over 400 after treatment, and his viral load is now negligible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's going on here. The key points are the recurrence of symptoms and the new imaging findings. Since he had a previous episode treated appropriately, but now has a new infiltrate in a different lobe, maybe there's a different infection or something else.\n\nHis CD4 count improved significantly, which is good, but the new symptoms could be a relapse of the same infection, a new opportunistic infection, or maybe something else like an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS occurs when the immune system starts recovering and overreacts to an existing infection, making symptoms worse even though treatment is working. Since his CD4 went up so much, that's a possibility here.\n\nThe options given are: continue current treatment (A), determine drug sensitivities (B), discontinue antimicrobials (C), get a D-dimer (D), or start steroids and stop ART (E). \n\nOption E suggests stopping antiretroviral therapy (ART) and starting high-dose steroids. That seems drastic. Stopping ART is generally not advised unless there's a specific reason. But IRIS is a condition where steroids might be used. If this is IRIS, then continuing ART is important, but adding steroids could help manage the inflammation. However, stopping ART would be bad because his viral load was under control. \n\nOption B is about drug sensitivities. If it's a new infection, maybe they need to check for drug resistance. But the previous treatment worked, so maybe the same pathogens? But the new nodules and adenopathy could be something else. However, the question is about the next step. \n\nOption A says to continue current therapies. If it's IRIS, continuing ART is correct, but maybe adding steroids. But the options don't have that.

The skin lesions are thick and don't break under pressure. The physical exam shows Figure A, which I can't see, but the description might give clues.\n\nFirst, considering his camping history, I should think about outdoor-related infections. Lyme disease comes to mind, but the skin lesions there are typically erythema migrans, which are red and expanding, but maybe not the thick ones here. Then there's Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can present with a rash, but again, the description here is thick lesions that don't blanch. Wait, maybe something like a fungal infection? But the other factors?\n\nHe's sexually active with multiple partners, so sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a possibility. Syphilis can present with a chancre or later stages with skin lesions. The secondary stage of syphilis has a rash that might not blanch, but I'm not sure. However, the patient was treated for pneumonia with azithromycin, which might not cover syphilis (which requires penicillin). But the question mentions the skin lesions are thick and don't break under pressure. Maybe something like a chancre, but that's usually a single ulcer.\n\nAlternatively, the thick lesions that don't blanch when pressed might suggest something like a panniculitis, which is inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. Panniculitis lesions are typically tender, firm nodules or plaques. The options include D) Panniculitis. But why would that be linked to his history?\n\nWait, the options given are (A) IgG in a fish-net pattern, which is seen in certain autoimmune conditions like epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. (B) Linear IgG along the basement membrane is seen in conditions like bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus, but those usually have blistering lesions. The question says the lesions don't break when pressure is applied, so maybe not bullous. (C) Multi-nucleated giant cells could be in conditions like granuloma annulare or certain infections.

The physical exam shows a skin finding in Figure A (which we can't see) and fine, lace-like white lines on the buccal mucosa.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible diagnoses given the options. The key points here are the presence of a rash with itching, the mucosal lesions (white lines on the buccal mucosa), and his risk factors. Let's go through each option:\n\nA) Atopic dermatitis: Typically starts in childhood, often with a family history of atopy. It's usually more scaly and might have specific distribution patterns, but the mucosal involvement here (white lines) isn't classic for atopic dermatitis. Plus, the patient's age and occupational exposure might be more relevant.\n\nB) Lichen planus: This can present with pruritic, polygonal,\u7d2b\u7ea2\u8272\u7684\u4e18\u75b9 (purple-red papules) and may involve mucous membranes. The white lace-like lines on the buccal mucosa are called Wickham striae, which are a classic sign of lichen planus. That's a strong point here. The patient's other conditions like hepatitis C are important because lichen planus can be associated with hepatitis C infection. In fact, chronic hepatitis C is a known trigger or associated condition for lichen planus. So this seems very plausible.\n\nC) Prurigo nodularis: This presents with firm, hyperkeratotic nodules, usually on the extremities, caused by chronic scratching. The description here mentions a rash with itching but the mucosal findings don't fit. Plus, the white lines on the mucosa aren't typical for prurigo.\n\nD) Psoriasis: Commonly has silvery scales over red plaques. Psoriasis can affect the scalp, elbows, knees, but mucosal involvement is rare except in cases of inverse psoriasis (in body folds) which doesn't explain the white lines.

Testosterone levels are often over 200 ng/dL, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone may also be slightly elevated as it is an androgen precursor. The androgen excess may result in symptoms such as facial and abdominal hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, deepening voice, and acne. Treatment involves staging the tumor and surgical resection of the tumor if possible.\n\nDurmus et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. They discuss how this tumor generally has a favorable prognosis compared to malignant epithelial tumors. They recommend using fertility-preserving surgeries in younger patients.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows an ultrasound of the left ovary, which has a predominantly solid mass with vascularity and some cystic spaces (red circle). These findings are consistent with an ovarian tumor.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Adrenal tumors may secrete androgens and cause similar symptoms of virilization, but the presence of a malignant-appearing ovarian mass in this patient is more consistent with ovarian pathology. Furthermore, adrenal tumors typically secrete DHEAS, which can be a helpful test for localizing the source of androgen excess. Treatment is with surgical excision.\n\nAnswer B: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) results from one of several possible enzyme deficiencies in the steroid pathway and may appear later in life as virilization of a woman. While 17-hydroxyprogesterone elevation is a strong indicator of the most common subtype of CAH, this patient\u2019s ultrasound findings suggest ovarian pathology instead, which could also elevate this androgen precursor. Treatment is with hormone replacement therapy.\n\nAnswer C: Ovarian hyperthecosis is hyperplasia of the theca interna of the ovary, which produces androgens. Testosterone levels would be elevated and virilization may occur, but ultrasound findings would show a bilateral increase in stromal tissue as opposed to a unilateral solid mass. Treatment is with hormonal therapy.\n\nAnswer E: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can also cause elevated testosterone, though levels are typically lower than 100 ng/dL. Frank virilization with clitoromegaly and voice deepening would not be expected with PCOS, nor would an ovarian mass.

Her labs show elevated testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, but DHEAS is within normal range. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible causes of hirsutism and the associated symptoms. The key here is the combination of signs like hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities, and an adnexal mass. The elevated testosterone suggests androgen excess. The 17-hydroxyprogesterone is slightly elevated (214 vs normal <200), which might be a clue. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Adrenal tumor: Adrenal tumors can produce androgens. However, DHEAS is a marker for adrenal androgens. Since her DHEAS is normal, maybe not the adrenal gland. But some tumors might produce different hormones. Wait, 17-hydroxyprogesterone is a bit high. In congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), 17-hydroxyprogesterone is elevated because of enzyme deficiency. But she's an adult, and CAH is usually diagnosed in childhood. However, non-classic CAH can present later. But her DHEAS is normal, which might not fit. Hmm.\n\nB) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): The classic form is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, leading to increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone. But in non-classic CAH, symptoms are milder. Her 17-OHP is just over 200, which is slightly elevated. But DHEAS is normal. Wait, in CAH, DHEAS might be elevated because of increased androgen production. Since her DHEAS is normal, maybe that's not it. Or maybe the elevation is not enough? Not sure.\n\nC) Ovarian hyperthecosis: This is a condition where the ovaries produce excess androgens. It's associated with PCOS-like symptoms but often in women with hyperandrogenism and obesity. The presence of an adnexal mass might be a thecoma or fibroma.

Individuals are surveyed using a validated method and followed up in 6-month intervals for 5 years. At the end of the study period, 40% of individuals have replied to the survey throughout the entire period. Analyzing only those subjects who responded throughout the entire period, it is determined that opioid use disorder only minimally impairs individuals in their daily functioning.

        "answer_idx": "A",
        "reason": "This study following individuals who abuse opioids with a 40% follow-up response rate suggests that opioid use disorder (known for impairing daily functioning) has only a minor effect on patient functionality. This is most likely secondary to attrition bias, or a loss to follow-up of participants in a non-random fashion whereby more severe cases stopped responding and were thus left out.\n\nBias in studies distorts outcomes and can make interpreting results challenging. For this reason, it is important to be meticulous when designing a study with every effort to minimize bias. The attrition bias can occur when individuals are lost to follow-up in a non-random fashion. For example, consider the assessment of daily functionality via a validated method in individuals with coronary artery disease. Those who are severely impaired from disease progression may not follow up in this study, thus altering results and removing more severe cases from the analysis. Having a higher response rate can help mitigate this bias, but is more costly as it may be difficult to ensure that every participant follows up.\n\nNunan et al. discuss the attrition bias. They note how it can affect studies and the data collected. They recommend mitigating the attrition bias for more accurate results and clinical application.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Confounding variables are variables that are correlated with the studied variable that better explain the difference between 2 groups. For example, it may be found that alcohol is associated with lung cancer when in reality, the confounding variable of smoking (more common in individuals who drink alcohol) explains this difference.\n\nAnswer C: Late-look bias occurs when patients with severe disease are not studied because they are dead, critically ill, or unavailable to be studied, making the disease overall appear less severe. For example, patients with HIV may not have increased morbidity and mortality in a study. However, this may be a result of all the critically ill cases being too sick or dead and thus unable to participate thus distorting the outcome.\n\nAnswer D: Recall bias occurs when individuals with disease or an adverse outcome are more likely to recall an exposure given the occurred outcome, skewing their memory and thus the results. For example, pregnant mothers who have a newborn with a defect or condition may be more likely to recall certain exposures (such as exposure to pollution).\n\nAnswer E: Volunteer bias occurs when people who volunteer for a study are fundamentally different from the general population or those who do not volunteer. An example may be individuals volunteering in a study involving exercise as those who are interested in participating in an exercise study may be more motivated or healthier at baseline.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAttrition bias occurs when individuals are lost to follow-up in a non-random fashion leading to skewed results.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the study is about opioid use disorder and its effect on daily functioning. They surveyed people using a validated method and followed up every 6 months for 5 years. But only 40% completed all the surveys. Then, when they analyzed only those who responded throughout, they found that the disorder only minimally impairs daily functioning.\n\nHmm, the question is asking which bias most likely occurred here. The options are attrition, confounding, late-look, recall, or volunteer bias. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these biases means. \n\nAttrition bias happens when participants drop out of a study over time, and if the dropouts have different characteristics from those who stay, it can skew results. Since the study followed up over 5 years and only 40% stayed, maybe those who dropped out were different. If the ones who stayed (the 40%) are different in a way that affects the outcome, like maybe they have milder cases, then the results (that opioid use doesn't impair much) might be because the more severely affected people dropped out. That would be attrition bias because the analysis is only on the completers, not accounting for those who left.\n\nConfounding variable is a factor that influences both the dependent and independent variables, causing a spurious association. But the question here is more about the study design's loss of participants, not an external variable.\n\nLate-look bias refers to studies where outcomes are assessed long after the intervention, possibly leading to recall issues, but that's more about timing of assessment, maybe not exactly here.\n\nRecall bias is when participants remember past events differently, but this study uses surveys over time, so maybe not the main issue here.\n\nVolunteer bias is when the volunteers for the study are different from the general population. But the problem here is about those who stayed in the study versus those who left, not about initial volunteers.\n\nSo the key point is that they only analyzed the 40% who responded throughout. If the people who dropped out had more severe impairment, then the remaining group's results would understate the actual effect. That's attrition bias because the analysis is based on a non-random subset of the original sample, leading to biased results. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nA",

        "reason": "This patient with fluctuating changes in behavior and cognition, visual hallucinations, memory loss, and extrapyramidal symptoms (bradykinesia, postural instability) most likely has Lewy body dementia. Lewy body dementia is characterized histologically by Lewy bodies, which are intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions of alpha-synuclein (shown in Figure C).\n\nAlpha-synuclein is normally abundantly present in its unfolded form in neurons. Abnormal folding of alpha-synuclein leads to aggregation into insoluble fibrils. These intracytoplasmic aggregates (Lewy bodies) are seen in Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy, which are collectively referred to as alpha-synucleinopathies. Lewy body dementia is the second most common degenerative dementia and presents with fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism (bradykinesia, postural instability, rigidity, and a resting tremor), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder, autonomic dysfunction, and sensitivity to antipsychotics. Lewy body dementia can be distinguished from Parkinson disease with dementia by the timing of symptoms. In Lewy body dementia, cognitive symptoms begin at the same time as or 1 year prior to the onset of movement symptoms whereas in Parkinson disease the cognitive symptoms classically occur over 1 year after motor symptoms. There is no cure for Lewy body dementia, and treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms.\n\nArnaoutoglou et al. reviewed the epidemiology, pathology, treatment, and future directions for research of Lewy body dementia. The authors found potential genetic bases for Lewy body dementia, including mutations in the GBA gene. They recommended that further research be conducted on the therapeutic implications of these genetic findings.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained brain biopsy of a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Characteristic spongiform changes in neurons (yellow boxes) and agglomerated prions (orange arrows) are seen in this slide.\n\nFigure/Illustration B shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with a small lacunar infarct on low magnification. A central area of tissue loss (yellow outline) and surrounding residual gliosis (orange arrows) are seen in this slide.\n\nFigure/Illustration C shows a brain biopsy of a patient with Lewy body dementia stained with mouse anti-alpha-synuclein antibody and counterstained with hematoxylin. Lewy bodies (intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions of alpha-synuclein) are indicated by orange arrows. Note that Lewy bodies are always found intracellularly (neurons highlighted by blue boxes).\n\nFigure/Illustration D shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with Alzheimer disease. Extracellular neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer disease are indicated by black arrows.\n\nFigure/Illustration E shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with frontotemporal dementia. A characteristic Pick cell (red box), or ballooned neuron, with dissolved chromatin (yellow arrow), is seen in this slide.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Figure A shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive dementia that manifests with poor concentration, declining executive function, startle myoclonus, 14-3-3 protein on lumbar puncture, and synchronous sharp wave complexes on electroencephalogram (EEG). Clinical decline occurs over the course of weeks and months, culminating in death within a year. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease shows spongiform vacuolation due to the accumulation of abnormal prion protein (PrPsc).\n\nAnswer B: Figure B shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with a small lacunar infarct. Lacunar infarcts may be asymptomatic or cause focal neurologic deficits such as motor hemiparesis, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, or dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome depending on the territory involved. Lacunar strokes will show diffuse eosinophilia of the affected area, followed by liquefactive necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration, followed by macrophages with surrounding reactive gliosis, finally leading to an area of tissue loss with residual gliosis.\n\nAnswer D: Figure D shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer disease presents with a gradual cognitive decline with difficulty completing activities of daily living. Memory is the most prominently affected domain. Visual hallucinations, fluctuating levels of cognition, and extrapyramidal symptoms are not common in Alzheimer disease. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles may be seen on brain biopsy.\n\nAnswer E: Figure E shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with frontotemporal dementia (Pick disease). The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia is associated with early-onset personality and behavioral changes, and it may be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms. Unlike Lewy body dementia, memory is usually not affected in frontotemporal dementia until late in the disease course. frontotemporal dementia is characterized by Pick cells (ballooned neurons with dissolved chromatin) and Pick bodies, round intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.\n\nBullet Summary:\nLewy body dementia presents with alterations in consciousness, disorganized speech, visual hallucinations, extrapyramidal symptoms, early compromise of executive functions, and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions of alpha-synuclein (Lewy bodies) on biopsy.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a 2-year history of fluctuating behavior, hallucinations, speech issues, and visual hallucinations of \"small people\" and animals. She has a history of hypertension and COPD, managed with amlodipine, albuterol, ipratropium, and fluticasone. She had to retire due to memory problems. On exam, she now has slowed movements and balance issues that weren't present a year ago.\n\nThe question is asking which pathological finding would be seen on a brain biopsy. The options are figures A to E, but since I can't see the figures, I need to think about the key clinical clues here.\n\nFirst, the symptoms: fluctuating cognition, hallucinations (especially visual), speech disorganization, and now movement issues like slowed movements and balance problems. The fact that her movements and balance are new compared to a year ago is important. The memory lapses leading to retirement suggest some cognitive decline.\n\nThe combination of cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism (slowed movements, balance issues) makes me think of a specific syndrome. Lewy body dementia comes to mind. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is characterized by fluctuating levels of attention and alertness, recurrent visual hallucinations (often of people or animals), and Parkinsonian motor symptoms like bradykinesia and gait disturbances. It often presents before or around the same time as Alzheimer's symptoms.\n\nIn terms of pathology, Lewy bodies are alpha-synuclein-positive intraneuronal inclusions. They are found in the substantia nigra, cerebral cortex, and other areas. The presence of Lewy bodies would be the key here. \n\nOther possibilities to consider: Alzheimer's has plaques and tangles, but the fluctuating cognition and early parkinsonism are less typical. Parkinson's disease dementia would have later cognitive decline after motor symptoms, but here the cognitive issues started before the motor symptoms (since she had memory issues leading to retirement before the recent movement problems). Frontotemporal dementia usually presents with behavioral changes and atrophy in frontal/temporal lobes, but the hallucinations and parkinsonism are less common. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is more about rapidly progressive dementia, which doesn't fit the 2-year duration here.\n\nSo the most likely answer is the one showing Lewy bodies.

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 6-month-old boy with abnormal movements. The episodes described are paroxysmal, lasting 1-2 seconds but clustering every 20-30 seconds. The symptoms include crying, bending at the waist, and jerking of limbs. Also, there's a regression in milestones like rolling over less, worse head control, and not smiling socially anymore. The EEG shows chaotic slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges during the spells.\n\nFirst, I need to think about possible causes of infantile seizures with regression. The options given are T-type calcium channels, NMDA receptor antibodies, low GABA, excess CRH, or vitamin B6 deficiency.\n\nThe key here is the age and the regression. Ohtahara syndrome is an early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, but that usually starts in the first few months and has different EEG patterns like burst-suppression. West syndrome comes to mind with spasms, but the description here doesn't exactly fit. Dravet syndrome is another consideration. Dravet is associated with SCN1A gene mutations, which are sodium channel abnormalities, but the options don't mention sodium channels. Wait, the options have T-type calcium channels (A). Dravet is sodium, so maybe not that.\n\nAnother thought: Ohtahara is more burst-suppression, while West is hypsarrhythmia. The EEG here is chaotic with slowing and multifocal spikes. Hmm. The regression in milestones is a big clue. Also, the episodes are brief but in clusters. \n\nOption E is vitamin B6 deficiency. Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a thing. It presents in infancy with seizures that are hard to control, and sometimes respond to vitamin B6. The EEG might show multifocal spikes. Also, there can be developmental regression. The pathophysiology here would be due to an enzyme defect in the heme synthesis pathway, leading to accumulation of toxic substances, but the treatment is B6. So the deficiency of B6 would lead to seizures. \n\nOption A: T-type calcium channels are involved in some channelopathies. For example, GEFS+ (generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus) can have mutations in calcium channels, but I'm not sure if that's associated with this presentation. \n\nOption C: Decreased GABA levels could lead to seizures, but GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, in some cases like pyridox",

Catatonia should initially be treated with benzodiazepines like lorazepam.\n\nCatatonia is a state of psychomotor immobility and apathy that is associated with a mood disorder or psychosis. The diagnosis is made clinically by having at least 3 of the following symptoms: stupor (no psychomotor activity), negativism (no response to external stimuli), catalepsy (muscle rigidity in a position against gravity), waxy flexibility (maintaining positioning placed by the examiner), mutism, echolalia (mimicking speech), echopraxia (mimicking movements), stereotypy, grimacing, and non-purposeful agitation or mannerisms. Initial treatment involves benzodiazepines for symptomatic relief. If the patient is unresponsive to benzodiazepines, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be used.\n\nFrancis reviews the evidence regarding the treatment of patients with catatonia. He discusses how benzodiazepines can be used with rapid improvement in symptoms. He recommends electroconvulsive therapy in refractory cases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Benztropine and IV diphenhydramine can be used to treat an acute dystonic reaction. Dystonic reactions present as involuntary spasms or sustained contractions of the face, neck, torso, pelvis, extremities, and larynx. Medications that block dopamine D2 receptors, such as neuroleptics and antiemetics, carry the greatest risk.\n\nAnswer B: Cyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist that may be part of the treatment for serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome may occur as a result of the simultaneous use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). It presents with myoclonus, hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, and delirium.\n\nAnswer C: Electroconvulsive therapy is an effective treatment for catatonia but would be considered 2nd line to benzodiazepines for refractory cases.\n\nAnswer D: Haloperidol is an antipsychotic, which may worsen catatonia. It can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which can mimic catatonia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCatatonia can present in patients with a history of mood disorders and psychosis with symptoms of decreased motor activity, rigid posture, and mutism, and should be treated initially with a benzodiazepine.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 23-year-old woman with a history of depression who was switched from phenelzine to fluoxetine. She's presenting with symptoms like staring, not responding, staying in a fixed position, and being mute. These symptoms sound a lot like a catatonic episode.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what medications she's on. Phenelzine is a MAOI, and fluoxetine is an SSRI. Oh wait, combining MAOIs and SSRIs can lead to serotonin syndrome, but the timing here is important. She was recently switched, so maybe there's an interaction. But her symptoms don't exactly fit serotonin syndrome, which usually has agitation, hyperthermia, tachycardia, etc. Her vitals here are mostly normal except maybe a slightly elevated temperature, but not enough for serotonin syndrome.\n\nAlternatively, catatonia can be caused by underlying psychiatric conditions like depression, and certain medications. Since she was on phenelzine (MAOI) and then switched to fluoxetine (SSRI), that combination is a known dangerous interaction. But the symptoms here are more catatonic. Wait, but the question is about the most appropriate initial therapy.\n\nCatatonia treatment typically starts with benzodiazepines like lorazepam because they can help break the catatonic state. If that doesn't work, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is next. However, the options here include ECT (C) and lorazepam (E). \n\nWait, but another angle: the medication switch. Phenelzine and fluoxetine together can cause serotonin syndrome. But her symptoms don't fit that. Alternatively, maybe the switch caused a problem leading to catatonia. But the key here is the presentation. The physical exam shows she's in a fixed posture, mute, not responding. That's classic catatonia. \n\nSo the first-line treatment for catatonia is benzodiazepines. Lorazepam (E) would be first. If that fails, then ECT. So the answer should be E? But wait, some sources say that in catatonia, benzodiazepines are first-line. However, sometimes if it's treatment-resistant, ECT is used. But the question is asking for the most appropriate initial therapy. So E would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, could there be another consideration? Let me think again.

Clindamycin is anaerobic coverage but doesn't cover aerobes as well. Cephalexin is a first-gen cephalosporin, which covers Staph and Strep but not anaerobes or Bacteroides. Clindamycin plus doxycycline would cover a broader spectrum, including anaerobes and maybe some atypical bacteria. Wait, but why combine them? Clindamycin covers anaerobes and some Gram-positives, doxycycline covers anaerobes and some Gram-negatives. But maybe that's overkill?\n\nWait, the standard for dog bites is usually amoxicillin-clavulanate because it's broad enough. But the question mentions that the wound is over the MCP joint.

They discuss the importance of rapid initiation of antimicrobial therapy in these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 5: Bacterial or fungal meningitis can present with fever, headache, focal neurological deficits, and seizures but patients typically have meningeal signs such as pain with neck flexion. Cryptococcal meningitis is commonly seen in HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts < 100/mm^3.\n\nAnswer C: Cytomegalovirus encephalitis can present with fever, altered mental status, headache, and focal neurological deficits in patients with HIV infection. It typically presents in patients with severe immunodeficiency, often with CD4 cell count < 50/mm^3. This patient\u2019s CD4 cell count is 500/mm^3, making this less likely than an abscess.\n\nAnswer D: Epilepsy is a primary neurological disorder that can cause generalized tonic-clonic seizures but would not explain this patient\u2019s fever or unilateral headache. While Todd paralysis (focal weakness after a seizure) can occur after seizures, this patient\u2019s focal weakness predates his seizure. A primary seizure disorder is not diagnosed when seizures occur secondary to another process.\n\nBullet Summary:\nBrain abscess presents with fever, altered mental status, unilateral headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits in patients with risk factors for infection (for example HIV, bacterial endocarditis).",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 35-year-old man with HIV presenting with altered mental status, a recent history of right-sided headache, and some neurological findings. His CD4 count is 500, which is relatively preserved, but he's on antiretroviral therapy. The symptoms and signs need to be analyzed carefully.\n\nFirst, the altered mental status and high fever (104.2\u00b0F) are concerning. The headache has been present for five days. The physical exam shows weakness on the right side\u2014specifically shoulder abduction and elbow movements are weaker, but hip strength is slightly reduced too. The rest of the strength is normal. Then there's this odd eye movement (eyes rolling back) with extremity flexion/extension and incontinence, which stopped after a minute. That sounds like a possible neurologic event.\n\nThe options are bacterial meningitis, brain abscess, CMV encephalitis, epilepsy, or fungal meningitis. Let's go through each.\n\nBacterial meningitis typically presents with fever, neck stiffness (meningismus), photophobia, and altered mental status. However, the exam here mentions no neck pain on flexion, so maybe no nuchal rigidity? But the presence of focal weakness and the eye movements might not be typical for meningitis. Also, in HIV patients, bacterial meningitis can occur, but maybe less likely with a higher CD4?\n\nBrain abscess can present with focal neurological deficits, headache, fever. The CD4 is 500, so maybe not as high a risk for opportunistic infections, but possible. However, the eye signs are a bit confusing here.\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis is an opportunistic infection in HIV, but usually occurs at lower CD4 counts (like below 50). His CD4 is 500, so that's probably not it. Unless the treatment isn't working, but the question doesn't suggest that.\n\nEpilepsy: The event with eye rolling and incontinence could be a tonic-clonic seizure. But the description mentions that the eyes rolled back with extremity movements and then stopped. However, the altered mental status and focal weakness might not be typical for a simple seizure. Post-ictal states can have confusion, but the focal weakness could be a post-seizure effect, but maybe not persistent. Also, the headache and fever complicate this.",

The most appropriate next step in management is emergent escharotomy to restore blood flow.\n\nBurns can be caused by chemical, thermal, electrical, and radiation sources. The initial inflammation causes vasodilatation and hyperemia, which can progress to edema and local microvascular thrombosis. If not promptly addressed, tissue necrosis and irreversible damage can occur. Circumferential burns can evolve into eschars that constrict blood flow and cause distal compartment syndrome. A delta pressure (diastolic pressure minus local compartment pressure) lower than 30 mmHg is diagnostic. In the case of eschar-induced compartment syndrome, the most appropriate next step is escharotomy to alleviate pressure.\n\nOrmiston and Marappa-Ganeshan review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with compartment syndrome. They discuss how this condition can be caused by many different pathologies including burns. They recommend the emergent release of constrictive structures.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amputation may be necessary if the distal limb is completely necrotic and not salvageable. Timely release of the eschar can allow for reperfusion of the limb and prevent this outcome.\n\nAnswer C: Fasciotomy is the treatment of choice for compartment syndrome not due to a circumferential eschar, but in this case the least invasive surgical intervention should be performed first without releasing all the compartments of the lower leg. If escharotomy does not relieve the compartment syndrome then fasciotomy may be required.\n\nAnswer D: Intravenous fluid infusion based on the Parkland formula is part of comprehensive burn management, but would not address the underlying compartment syndrome, which is more urgent at this time.\n\nAnswer E: Transfer to a specialized burn center can be considered since circumferential burns are one of the admission criteria, but early escharotomy should be performed first.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCircumferential burns that cause eschars and compartment syndrome require an escharotomy.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 24-year-old man with epilepsy who had a thermal burn on his left leg from an ECG lead. He's in the ICU on midazolam for seizures and being monitored. Now, the nurse noticed his left toes are cold, there's significant edema, no pulses in the left leg, and a delta pressure of 25 mmHg. The options are amputation, escharotomy, fasciotomy, IV fluids via Parkland formula, or transfer to a burn center.\n\nFirst, the key findings here are the cold toes, edema, absent pulses, and elevated delta pressure. The delta pressure (the difference between the compartment pressure and the diastolic blood pressure) is a critical indicator here. A delta pressure of 25 mmHg is above the threshold that suggests compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome occurs when pressure within a muscle compartment rises high enough to compromise blood flow. The classic signs are pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness (the 5 Ps). Here, the patient has pain (screaming in pain initially, but now the main issue is the leg's condition), pallor (cold toes), edema, and absent pulses. The elevated delta pressure confirms it.\n\nThe treatment for acute compartment syndrome is fasciotomy. That's the surgical procedure to split the fascial compartments and relieve the pressure. Without timely intervention, it can lead to permanent muscle and nerve damage. The options given include fasciotomy (C), so that's likely the answer. \n\nAmputation (A) is a last resort and only done if there's irreversible tissue damage, which isn't indicated here yet. Escharotomy (B) is for circumferential burns that restrict circulation, but the question mentions a circumferential burn from the ECG lead, so maybe that's part of it? Wait, but escharotomy is typically for full-thickness burns where the eschar can't stretch, leading to compartment issues. However, the delta pressure is already elevated, so even if escharotomy was needed, the immediate issue is the compartment pressure. The Parkland formula (D) is for fluid resuscitation in burns, but the question doesn't mention the burn's size or depth, so maybe that's not the priority here. Transfer to a burn center (E) might be necessary, but the immediate next step would be to address the compartment syndrome first",

History and physical should focus on eliciting red flag symptoms, including traumatic etiology, constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss), history of malignancy, intravenous drug use, steroid use, and neurological deficits (e.g., saddle anesthesia, incontinence). The presence of any red flags should prompt further evaluation with imaging. Lumbar strain typically presents with acute low back pain after a precipitating event (e.g., lifting weight) with no red flag signs/symptoms and responds well to conservative management including activity modification, ice, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Prevention measures include strengthening of core muscles and education on proper lifting techniques. Physical therapy is a core component of treating patients with muscle strains.\n\nKnezevic et al. review lower back pain. They note the many potential causes and symptoms that may present. They recommend a multimodal interdisciplinary approach to back pain given the many mechanisms, especially in complex cases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Disc herniation presents with radicular symptoms due to compression of spinal nerve roots as they exit the spinal canal, manifesting as a burning or shooting pain that radiates down either leg. Dermatomal sensory changes or hyporeflexia may be present depending on the spinal level affected (e.g., reduced Achilles reflex with S1 radiculopathy). The straight leg raise reproduces pain radiating down the leg on the affected side.\n\nAnswer B: Lumbar stenosis characteristically causes low back pain or lower extremity paresthesias with walking or standing that resolves when leaning forward (\u201cshopping cart sign\u201d). This is referred to as neurogenic claudication. Involvement of spinal nerve roots can lead to sensory loss and weakness in the lower extremities.\n\nAnswer D: Osteoarthritis can cause low back pain and stiffness, but is an age-related degenerative disease that is less likely in this patient who presents acutely after activity. The patient also does not have the typical risk factors for osteoarthritis, which include advanced age, female sex, or obesity.\n\nAnswer E: Vertebral compression fracture occurs mainly in osteoporotic patients, whose reduced bone mineral density increases their risk for vertebral body collapse under stress. Vertebral compression fractures present with point tenderness at the midline over the site of fracture. Additionally, this patient has no risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., advanced age, post-menopausal women, low BMI).\n\nBullet Summary:\nLumbar strain presents as low back pain without red flag signs or symptoms (e.g., constitutional symptoms, neurologic deficits) and is treated conservatively with activity modification, ice, and core strengthening.",

The most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAortic dissections develop due to a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta, causing a second blood-filled lumen to form. Risk factors include hypertension, trauma, Marfan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and pregnancy. Prognosis depends on the location and severity of the intimal tear. Aortic dissections are often described by using the Stanford classification, where Type A involves the ascending aorta and Type B involves tears distal to the left subclavian artery. Patients classically present with chest pain described as \"tearing\" or \"ripping\" with radiation into the back, arms, or abdomen. Hypertension is common. Chest radiography characteristically demonstrates widening of the mediastinum due to accumulation of blood between layers of the wall of the aorta. Type A dissections are managed with heart rate control, blood pressure control, and surgery. Type B dissections are managed with blood pressure and heart rate control only.\n\nCooper et al. report on aortic dissections in adolescence. Although rare, aortic dissections have been seen in children with congenital heart disease, connective tissue disorders, or severe traumatic accidents. Severe, migrating abdominal pain should heighten suspicion for this diagnosis. The patient will often look worse clinically than can be explained by physical findings.\n\nFigure A depicts a chest radiograph demonstrating a widened superior mediastinum.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aspirin is administered for chest pain that is thought to be due to acute coronary syndrome. This patient's presentation, exam, and imaging findings suggest aortic dissection. Aspirin is contraindicated in aortic dissection due to the increased risk for bleeding.\n\nAnswer C: Echocardiography offers information on cardiac contractility, valve function, and the presence of effusions. It would not be an appropriate initial diagnostic test in aortic dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography may be used to make the diagnosis in patients who cannot undergo a CTA.\n\nAnswer D: Lorazepam would be appropriate for patients presenting with chest pain that is secondary to use of cocaine or other sympathomimetic drugs. Tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, hyperactive bowel sounds, and dilated pupils suggest a sympathomimetic toxidrome.\n\nAnswer E: Serum troponin testing is indicated for risk stratification of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate next step in management for patients with suspected aortic dissection and mediastinal widening on chest radiograph is CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 35-year-old man with sudden onset tearing chest pain that radiates to the back, arms, and abdomen. His blood pressure is really high (210/145), pulse is fast (130), and he's diaphoretic and anxious. The left wrist pulse is weaker than the right. The chest X-ray is mentioned but we can't see it. The options are next steps: aspirin, CT angiography, echo, lorazepam, or troponin.\n\nFirst, the key symptoms here are the tearing pain, which is classic for aortic dissection. The age is younger, but it can happen, especially with risk factors like hypertension. His BP is extremely elevated, which is a risk factor. The difference in pulses between left and right wrists suggests possible involvement of the aorta, maybe a dissection affecting a branch artery. \n\nThe question is about the next step. The options: Aspirin is for MI, but the pain isn't typical of a heart attack. Echocardiogram can detect aortic dissection but maybe not as definitive as CT. CT angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing aortic dissection. Echocardiography might be quicker but might not cover the entire aorta. The chest X-ray might show some signs like widened mediastinum, but it's not definitive. Since the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of aortic dissection, the next step should be imaging to confirm. CT angiography covers the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which is important because dissections can extend. So the answer is B. Echocardiography (C) is good for the heart and ascending aorta but might miss descending. Troponin (E) is for MI. Lorazepam (D) is for anxiety but not addressing the underlying issue. Aspirin (A) isn't the priority here. So the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\n\nB",

In the setting of his reduced appetite and trouble sleeping, mirtazapine is an appropriate medication to add.\n\nSSRIs (including paroxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, sertraline, and fluoxetine) are the first line treatment for major depression. For patients in whom an adequate trial of SSRI therapy has been ineffective, the first step in management is a trial of augmentation with a separate agent prior to switching to a different primary antidepressant medication. Mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, acts by inhibiting pre-synaptic alpha-2 receptors as well as 5HT2 and 5HT3 serotonin receptors. Notably, its side effect profile includes increased appetite and mild sleepiness, making it a good option for depressed patients with insomnia or decreased appetite. Mirtazapine is commonly used to augment primary antidepressant therapy. Augmentation with an additional agent should generally be attempted prior to switching to a different SSRI or other first line medication.\n\nDavies et. al review the pharmacologic management of depression. They note that while evidence is limited, there is some data to suggest benefit in augmentation with a secondary agent prior to switching to another first line therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Electroconvulsive therapy, while often extremely effective, is typically reserved for patients that are actively suicidal, unable to eat, or displaying psychotic symptoms. It is more commonly used after medications have failed.\n\nAnswer C: Switching to amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, would not be appropriate. Tricyclic antidepressants have a negative side effect profile and potential for severe toxicity.\n\nAnswer D: Switching to paroxetine, another SSRI medication, may be appropriate. However, this patient's particular constellation of symptoms (decreased appetite and insomnia) suggest that he would likely respond well to mirtazapine.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, would not be appropriate. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors have a negative side effect profile and potential for severe drug-drug interaction.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMirtazapine (a noradrenergic and serotonergic antidepressant) is an appropriate next step for depressed patients with significant insomnia and decreased appetite who fail to respond to a trial of SSRI monotherapy.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 36-year-old man who started citalopram two months ago for depression. He's not improving much, but his side effects (nausea) have gone away. No suicidal thoughts now. Vital signs are mostly normal except maybe the respirations at 22, but that might be due to anxiety or the depression itself.\n\nThe options are to add mirtazapine, ECT, switch to amitriptyline, switch to paroxetine, or switch to phenelzine. \n\nFirst, I remember that when an SSRI like citalopram isn't working after several weeks, the next steps can vary. Sometimes they might increase the dose, but the question doesn't mention that. Alternatively, adding another medication like mirtazapine (which is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, also has antihistamine properties which can help with sleep and appetite) is a common approach. Mirtazapine can be added to an SSRI to enhance efficacy. \n\nSwitching to another SSRI like paroxetine might be an option, but sometimes switching within the same class doesn't help as much as combining or switching to a different class. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic, which can have more side effects like anticholinergic effects, so maybe not first line unless there's a reason. Phenelzine is a MAOI, which has dietary restrictions and interactions, so that's usually a later option. \n\nECT is typically considered in more severe cases, especially if there's psychosis, catatonia, or if the patient isn't responding to meds. The question says he denies suicidal thoughts now, so maybe not urgent enough for ECT yet. \n\nSo the most appropriate next step is probably adding mirtazapine (Option A). Switching to another SSRI (D) might not be as effective as augmentation. So I think the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nA",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with stiffness and a decreased range of motion in his shoulders suggestive of a diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis.\n\nAdhesive capsulitis classically presents in elderly, sedentary patients with a chief complaint of stiffness. On physical exam, the key findings are a loss of active, but more importantly, passive range of motion. It is the loss of passive range of motion that suggests a diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis over rotator cuff injuries, biceps tendinopathy, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and subacromial bursitis. The diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is made clinically; however, radiography, MRI, and ultrasound can be used to rule out other diagnoses. Treatment includes NSAIDs and physical therapy and can include steroids.\n\nRamirez reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of adhesive capsulitis. He discusses how non-operative management consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, short-term oral corticosteroids, intra-articular corticosteroid injections, and physiotherapy. He recommends manipulation under anesthesia and arthroscopic capsule release in patients who fail conservative management.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Biceps tendinopathy presents with pain and weakness overlying the long head of the biceps tendon. This tendon runs in the intertubercular groove on the anterior aspect of the proximal humerus. Patients will often present with pain with resisted flexion of the elbow. Treatment is surgical debridement in patients who fail conservative measures.\n\nAnswer C: Glenohumeral osteoarthritis presents with vague and diffuse pain that is exacerbated by activity in addition to a loss of range of motion of the shoulder. Though this patient is experiencing a decreased range of motion, the decreased passive range of motion is more specific for adhesive capsulitis. Treatment is with a total shoulder replacement in patients who fail conservative measures.\n\nAnswer D: Rotator cuff impingement presents with pain and weakness of the upper extremity, but also can present with a decreased range of motion as this patient experienced. Of note, the passive range of motion will not be significantly affected by this disease. Treatment is with surgical reconstruction or debridement of the rotator cuff if initial measures fail.\n\nAnswer E: Subacromial bursitis presents with localized tenderness, decreased range of motion, pain with motion, and sometimes erythema/edema. Though this patient is experiencing a decreased range of motion and pain with motion, the decreased passive range of motion suggests a diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Treatment is with rest and oral anti-inflammatory medications.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAdhesive capsulitis presents with pain and a decreased passive and active range of motion.",

The options are adhesive capsulitis, biceps tendinopathy, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, rotator cuff impingement, or subacromial bursitis.\n\nFirst, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) is common in diabetics and presents with gradual stiffness and pain, especially in middle-aged to older adults. The decreased active and passive ROM fits, as does the sedentary lifestyle, which can contribute. \n\nBiceps tendinopathy usually causes pain in the anterior shoulder, maybe with resisted supination. The exam here mentions pain limiting strength, but not sure if that's the main issue.\n\nGlenohumeral osteoarthritis is less common unless there's prior injury. The patient's obesity might increase risk, but the key symptoms here might not align as much with OA's grating or crepitus.\n\nRotator cuff impingement or subacromial bursitis typically involve pain with overhead movements, like reaching up (which he has trouble with). Impingement can cause pain when lifting the arm, especially in certain positions. But the decreased range of motion both actively and passively is a key point. Adhesive capsulitis usually has both active and passive limited ROM because the capsule is tight. In impingement, passive might be okay if someone else moves the arm, but the patient here has decreased passive as well, which points more towards capsulitis.\n\nSo, considering the diabetes (a risk factor for adhesive capsulitis), the age, the stiffness, and the reduced both active and passive movements, the most likely is adhesive capsulitis. The other options don't fit as well. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nA",

The most important initial step in management is a lateral canthotomy to alleviate retrobulbar pressure.\n\nA retrobulbar hematoma (or hemorrhage) occurs after blunt trauma to the eye. Presenting symptoms may include eye pain, photophobia, proptosis (an eye that appears to be anteriorly displaced), decreased visual acuity, and conjunctival injection. It is important to perform a thorough exam including a slit lamp exam and a fluorescein stain to rule out other traumatic injuries such as a globe rupture. Tonometry can be used to assess for increased intraocular pressure. A pressure > 20 mmHg suggests a diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome, a vision-threatening condition. Immediate management with a lateral canthotomy is indicated in order to relieve pressure on the optic nerve and retina and save the patient\u2019s vision. Further management may require drainage of the hematoma in the operating room.\n\nBurkat et al. review the technique for performing a lateral canthotomy to relieve pressure in retrobulbar hematoma. The authors first excise the skin and orbicularis muscle at the lateral canthal angle in a horizontal direction for approximately 10 mm. The authors then recommend performing an inferior cantholysis by incising the inferior crus (a thick fibrous band connecting the lateral lower eyelid to the orbital rim) near the orbital rim.\n\nFigure A demonstrates proptosis on physical exam which raises concern for a retrobulbar hematoma that is likely increasing orbital compartment pressure.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the head and facial bones would be appropriate if there was a concern for facial fracture. It would delay necessary and vision-saving interventions to perform a CT scan in the setting of orbital compartment syndrome. However, cross-sectional imaging may be performed after the pressure is relieved.\n\nAnswer B: Cyclopentolate is a cycloplegic that can be used to reduce pain in traumatic iritis. This typically presents after blunt trauma to the eye with erythema, photophobia, blurry vision, and cell/flare in the anterior chamber on slit lamp exam. A sluggish pupil may also be seen; however, increased intraocular pressure would not be seen in this condition.\n\nAnswer D: Orbital ultrasound could be used for diagnoses such as a retinal detachment which presents with flashes of light, floaters, and visual field loss like a \u201ccurtain coming down over the eye.\u201d An ultrasound would demonstrate the detached retina in the back of the eye. Management involves elevating the head of the bed and surgical reattachment.\n\nAnswer E: Topical timolol and pilocarpine in addition to brimonidine, acetazolamide, and possible iridotomy would be the appropriate management of acute closed-angle glaucoma which presents with a rock-hard eye, blurry vision, a mid-dilated and fixed pupil, as well as a headache.

His vital signs are mostly normal except for a slightly elevated blood pressure and pulse. The physical exam shows conjunctival injection in the left eye. His left pupil is sluggish, and his visual acuity is worse in that eye.

Let's think through each.\n\nFirst, the high IOP. Elevated IOP after trauma could be due to a condition like angle recession or maybe a hyphema (bleeding in the anterior chamber). But the fluorescein stain is unremarkable, so maybe no corneal abrasion. The sluggish pupil suggests possible damage to the iris or ciliary body, maybe a traumatic iritis or something more serious like a blowout fracture.\n\nOption A: CT scan. That's often done for facial fractures or orbital fractures. But the immediate issue here is the high IOP. A CT might be needed, but is it the next step?\n\nOption B: Cyclopentolate is a cycloplegic. It's used to dilate the pupil and relax the ciliary muscle. If there's uveitis or inflammation, this could help, but the question mentions the pupil is sluggish. Maybe to check for other issues, but not sure if that's the priority here.\n\nOption C: Lateral canthotomy. This is a procedure done to relieve pressure in the orbit, typically in cases of orbital compartment syndrome. High IOP could be a sign of that. If there's a blowout fracture, maybe not, but if the pressure is really high, a canthotomy might be needed to prevent optic nerve damage. The pressure here is 45, which is very high. So maybe this is the answer.\n\nOption D: Orbital ultrasound. Could help assess for things like retinal detachment, hematoma, or other structural issues.

Risk factors include residence in or previous visits to endemic regions, work in hospitals or nursing homes, imprisonment, and immunosuppression. Treatment typically requires 2 phases: an intensive phase involving 2 months of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) therapy and a continuation phase involving 4 additional months of just isoniazid and rifampin.

On exam, he's thin, has crackles in the right upper lobe, and the chest X-ray (though we can't see it) is probably important. The options are antibiotics, biopsy, antifungal, TB treatment, or vancomycin.\n\nFirst, the symptoms: fevers, night sweats, weight loss\u2014those are classic for tuberculosis (TB), especially given his risk factors like opiate use (which can be linked to higher TB risk) and being in prison (a congregate setting where TB can spread). The crackles in the right upper lobe are a common site for TB pneumonia. The chest X-ray might show a cavitary lesion or infiltrate in the upper lobe, which is typical for TB.\n\nThe options: D is RIPE therapy, which is the standard four-drug regimen for TB.

Biopsy might be needed if there's a mass or if the diagnosis isn't clear, but with classic symptoms and risk factors, starting treatment is better. Itraconazole is for fungal infections, which might be considered but TB is more likely here. Vancomycin is for MRSA or other Gram-positive bacteria, which doesn't fit the presentation. \n\nSo the next step should be starting TB treatment while confirming with tests like sputum AFB or culture.

The most appropriate way to prevent this error from occurring is a system-based approach, such as adding an alert in the electronic medical system for medications that sound similar.\n\nMedical errors commonly occur in the medical system given the complexity of delivering patient care. The best way to prevent future errors from occurring is a systems-based approach where the system is built to catch errors rather than relying on the diligence of staff. In a systems-based approach, there is an algorithmic method set in place for situations where errors are common. Examples of systems-based approaches to avoiding medical errors include time-outs for procedures, use of the electronic medical record and ordering system to generate stops and checks, and built-in procedures such as a pharmacist verifying all medical orders. The best way to prevent future errors, when possible, is a systems-based approach as it does not rely solely on individuals given that individuals are fallible and may not always avoid mistakes.\n\nCondren et al. review a systems based approach in the medical system. They note that a systems-based approach reduces medication errors. For this reason, systems-based approaches are recommended whenever possible.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Entering medications only on morning rounds with multiple providers is not a plausible strategy as patients will not receive medications they may need at other times, such as overnight. It is always a good idea to verify medications with the team on morning rounds to catch any possible errors that may be missed, but this would not necessarily fix errors that occur at other times of the day.\n\nAnswer C: Having nursing perform the medication reconciliation is not the best solution in this case, as the core problem was that the wrong medication was entered due to similar-sounding medication names. However, it is always a good idea to have multiple providers (e.g., nurses, pharmacists) verify information, check this with the physician team, and then verify the dose and route of administration when giving the medication.\n\nAnswer D: Reprimanding and educating the resident to check medications more carefully is not a solution to this problem. It does not seem that the resident does not understand the pharmacology or medication prescribed but made an understandable error. Explaining the need for care is important; reprimanding the resident is not.\n\nAnswer E: Verifying the patient\u2019s home medications with the patient should always be performed, but it would not fix this issue with similar-sounding medications. It would catch errors such as new medications that are not on the patient\u2019s medication list or out-of-date medications remaining on the list.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA systems-based approach is the most appropriate way to prevent future errors from occurring.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the scenario is a resident ordered clonazepam instead of clobazam, leading to oversedation and ICU transfer. The question is about preventing this in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to think about why the mix-up happened. The names sound similar, right? Clobazam and clonazepam are both benzodiazepines, and their names are close, which can lead to errors. So the key issue here is medication name similarity causing an ordering error.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Add an alert in the EMR for similar-sounding meds. That makes sense because if the system flags when two meds with similar names are being ordered, it could prevent this. \n\nB) Enter meds only in the morning with multiple providers. Maybe having more people check, but that's more about process timing and team involvement. Not sure if that directly addresses the name similarity issue.\n\nC) Have nursing do med reconciliation. Nurses do check meds, but if the order was already entered wrong by the doctor, nursing might not catch it during reconciliation if they rely on the order. Or maybe they would, but the root cause is the similar names.\n\nD) Reprimand and educate the resident. While education is good, relying on individual vigilance might not be as effective as a system change. People make mistakes, so a system alert would be better.\n\nE) Verify with the patient. The patient might not know the exact names, or maybe they can confirm, but if the error was in the ordering step, verifying with the patient might not catch it unless the patient can specify the exact medication name. But some patients might just say \"my seizure med\" or something generic.\n\nSo the best option is probably A. Because the problem is the similar names leading to an ordering error. An alert in the system would help catch that when someone tries to order a med that's similar to another one the patient is supposed to take. That's a system-level fix which is more reliable than relying on people to always check carefully (D) or process changes that might not address the root cause (B, C, E).\n</think>\n\nA",

Given that he has no other associated injuries, trephination is the only management indicated.\n\nA subungual hematoma occurs after trauma to the finger leading to a collection of blood under the fingernail. Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children. The authors find that there was no difference in complications or outcomes between nail bed repair and trephination; however, the cost in the nail trephination group was lower.

Failure to repair a nailbed laceration could lead to permanent deformity of the fingernail when it regrows.\n\nAnswer C: Observation is inappropriate as the accumulation of blood under the nail in a subungual hematoma could lead to ischemia and permanent injury to the nailbed.

His vitals are all normal, no fever, and the physical exam shows something in Figure A, which we can't see, but the radiograph shows a smooth cortex without bone disruption. So, the X-ray is normal\u2014no fracture.\n\nThe options are about management. Let's go through each. \n\nFirst, the question is asking for the most appropriate management. Since the radiograph shows no bone fracture (smooth cortex, no disruption), that rules out a broken bone. So, the injury is likely a soft tissue injury, maybe a contusion or a hematoma from the trauma.\n\nOption A is excision and histological exam. That sounds like surgery to remove something and check it. But why would they do that here? Unless there's a tumor or something suspicious, but the X-ray is normal. Probably not needed here.\n\nOption B: Fingernail removal. That's usually done if there's a subungual hematoma (blood under the nail) causing pain. If the nail is intact but there's a lot of blood underneath, trephination (drilling a hole) is done to relieve pressure. But the question mentions trephination as option E. So maybe B is removing the whole nail, which is more invasive. But if the pain is controlled, maybe not necessary.\n\nOption C: Observation. Since there's no fracture, and the pain is managed, maybe just watch it. The patient is otherwise healthy, no other issues. So maybe just rest, ice, elevation, and follow up.\n\nOption D: Operative repair. That would be for more severe injuries, like lacerations, tendon damage, or fractures. Since the X-ray is normal, and no mention of open wound or tendon issues, probably not needed.\n\nOption E: Trephination. As I thought earlier, that's for subungual hematoma. If the figure shows a blackened nail from blood, they might do a small hole to relieve pain. But the question says pain is controlled with acetaminophen. So maybe not necessary. But if there's a large hematoma, even without pain, sometimes they do it to prevent nail loss. But the question is about the most appropriate.\n\nThe key points here:",

The infection is contracted during contact with infected livestock. The first-line treatment is doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin. Progression to systemic anthrax would result in pulmonary (flu-like symptoms and hemoptysis) or gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, and dysentery) symptoms and would require treatment with clindamycin plus ciprofloxacin. Patients with meningitis due to anthrax require antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin plus meropenem plus linezolid. Additionally, antitoxins such as raxibacumab and adjunctive therapies such as glucocorticoids should be considered. In addition to photosensitivity, adverse effects of doxycycline include gastrointestinal upset (most common), teeth discoloration, and inhibition of bone growth in children. Doxycycline is teratogenic and should not be prescribed during pregnancy.\n\nMigone et al. discuss the use of raxibacumab, a monoclonal antibody against a component of the anthrax toxin, in treating inhalational anthrax.

        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 46-year-old farmer with a new skin lesion on his arm that he was treated for four days ago. Now he has a new blistering erythematous rash on his arms and shoulders after getting sunburned despite using sunscreen. His history includes type 2 diabetes controlled with metformin, and he smokes a pack a day.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the possible causes of a blistering rash that appeared after sun exposure. The key here is the timing: the rash developed after sunburn, which happened an hour into his workday. The fact that he was using sunscreen but still got sunburned might suggest something else is at play. \n\nLooking at the options, the question is about the most likely explanation. The previous lesion's treatment is important here. The options include adverse effects of ciprofloxacin (A) or doxycycline (B), an allergic reaction (C), progression of the original disease (D or E). \n\nWait, the question mentions that the previous skin lesion was treated, but the new rash is different. The blistering and erythema after sun exposure could be a phototoxic reaction. Phototoxic drugs are common with certain antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, which is known to cause phototoxicity. Doxycycline, a tetracycline, can also cause phototoxic reactions. \n\nPhototoxicity presents as a sunburn-like reaction in sun-exposed areas, which matches the patient's description. Allergic reactions (like a rash) can also occur, but they usually aren't specifically linked to sun exposure. The progression of the original disease (like if it was something like cellulitis getting worse) might not explain the new rash's appearance after sun exposure. \n\nThe patient was prescribed treatment four days ago. If he's on ciprofloxacin or doxycycline, either could be the culprit. The question is which one is more likely. Let me think: doxycycline is often used for conditions like Lyme disease or rickettsial infections, while ciprofloxacin is a broader-spectrum fluoroquinolone. Since the original lesion's nature isn't specified, but the key here is the reaction after sun exposure. Both drugs can cause phototoxicity, but the options are separate. \n\nWait, the question says \"adverse effect of ciproflox",

Patients with Marfan syndrome classically present with a triad of musculoskeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular symptoms. The musculoskeletal findings include tall stature, long limbs, arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, and scoliosis. Patients with Marfan syndrome also often present with upward lens subluxation, and they are at increased risk of cardiac disease, including aortic regurgitation and aortic dissection.

They discuss how skeletal manifestations are often the initial presentation of this condition leading to diagnosis. They recommend screening for patients who are suspected to have this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Defective metabolism of methionine describes homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive deficiency of cystathionine synthase.

Those are deletion syndromes, but they involve developmental issues and other symptoms not mentioned here.\n\nOption D is mutations in COL5A1 or COL5A2. Those are collagen genes, specifically types V collagen. Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in FBN1, but Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (certain types) involve COL5A mutations. EDS can have joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, but lens subluxation is more common in Marfan. Wait, but some EDS types like classic or vascular might have lens issues. Hmm, but the patient's scoliosis and tall stature might fit Marfan more, but the question is about the specific gene here.\n\nOption E is RET proto-oncogene mutation. That's associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or Hirschsprung disease. Not related to lens issues.\n\nWait, going back.

If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, immediate prophylaxis is recommended. This category also includes all needlestick exposures. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects.

The key points here are the exposure details and the current guidelines for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).\n\nFirst, the patient is 26, had a negative HIV test two years ago. She's monogamous and no IV drug use, so her risk factors are low except for this needlestick. The source patient is HIV-positive, with a CD4 of 550 and a high viral load of 1.8 million copies/mL. However, the source started HAART three days ago. \n\nNow, the options are about what to do next. The main question is whether to start antiretrovirals immediately or wait and test first. \n\nI remember that for occupational exposure like a needlestick, the standard recommendation is to start PEP as soon as possible, ideally within hours, but up to 72 hours. The guidelines say to start empiric therapy even before the source's viral load is known, especially if the source is known to be HIV positive. \n\nThe source here is definitely HIV positive, so that's a given. The fact that the source started HAART three days ago might lower the viral load, but since HAART takes time to reduce viral load, the viral load at the time of exposure was high (1.8 million). Even though HAART was started, the immediate risk is based on the current status before treatment. \n\nThe options: \n\nA says to start triple therapy immediately. \n\nB suggests genotype testing first, but that might delay treatment, which isn't ideal. \n\nC and D talk about repeating serology first. But serology might not be positive yet, and waiting for results would delay PEP, which is time-sensitive. \n\nE says to repeat serology and start immediately. Wait, but the question is about the next step. The guidelines say start PEP immediately, then do the testing. \n\nThe correct approach is to start PEP right away, even before the results of the source's resistance tests. Genotype testing (option B) is more about choosing the right drugs if there's resistance, but initial PEP is standard triple therapy. \n\nSo the answer should be A. Let me check again. The source's viral load is high, so high risk. The exposure was percutaneous, which is a higher risk route. The fact that the source is on HAART for 3",

Given his history of heavy smoking, lung cancer should be ruled out with a chest CT with possible subsequent bronchoscopy for tissue biopsy.\n\nRecurrent pneumonia can be classified either as those confined to 1 anatomical location of the lung or those involving different portions of the lung. If recurrent pneumonia is limited to a single region, the patient should be evaluated for an anatomic obstruction, such as a mass or mucous plug. Obstruction will hinder mucociliary clearance and allow for the proliferation of bacteria, leading to recurrent infections. The most concerning etiology of such an obstruction is a tumor causing external bronchial compression. Thus, patients should be screened with a chest CT to rule out lung cancer in these cases. If lesions are identified on CT, subsequent bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy may be warranted. Treatment may involve radiotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or surgery depending on the underlying malignancy. Other causes of recurrent pneumonia limited to an anatomical region include recurrent aspiration secondary to tracheoesophageal disorders or seizures.\n\nPurysko et al. discuss the role of contrast enhancement in chest CTs. The authors find common indications for contrast-enhanced chest CTs include investigation for pulmonary embolism, pleural pathology, or hilar pathology. The authors recommend against the regular use of contrast enhancement in chest CTs outside of selected indications as they rarely provide additional diagnostic benefits while subjecting the patient to the risk of adverse effects with contrast agents.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Barium swallow is often done to investigate anatomical abnormalities of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as tracheoesophageal fistula or Zenker diverticulum. These can increase the risk of aspiration and lead to recurrent pneumonia. In a patient with positive risk factors for cancer, chest CT to rule out malignancy would be the most appropriate next step.\n\nAnswer C: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause secondary immunodeficiency, which can predispose patients to recurrent infections. These recurrent pneumonias would be expected to be in different regions of the lung and not anatomically confined.\n\nAnswer D: Interferon-gamma release assay can be used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB). Reactivation of TB will present clinically with fever, cough, hemoptysis, and night sweats. Chest radiography will commonly reveal an upper lobe infiltrate.\n\nAnswer E: Serum immunoglobulin levels would be an appropriate next step to diagnose primary immunodeficiencies such as common variable immunodeficiency or other antibody defects.

        "reason": "This patient with episodic abdominal pain, bloody stool, growth failure, and erythema nodosum most likely has Crohn disease. Disease involving the terminal ileum predisposes patients to vitamin B12 deficiency, which would cause anemia with an elevated serum methylmalonic acid level.\n\nCrohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that presents with abdominal pain, bloody stools, and growth failure in children. Extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn disease include fistula formation and erythema nodosum, which appear as multiple tender erythematous nodules that fade after 1-2 weeks into bluish plaques or macules that can be confused with bruises. Complications of Crohn disease when the disease involves the terminal ileum is vitamin deficiency and malabsorption. These deficiencies can include vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, zinc, and vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency presents with a macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia with hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear. Lab findings include elevated serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also associated with peripheral neuropathy and should be treated with intramuscular vitamin repletion.\n\nAkbulut presents the current state of evidence regarding vitamin deficiency in patients with Crohn disease. They found that vitamin B12 and folate levels are often low in patients with this disease. They recommend monitoring vitamin levels and providing repletion when necessary.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing erythematous nodules on the extensor surfaces of the legs (red circles). This finding is consistent with the latter stage of erythema nodosum.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Decreased mean corpuscular volume may be seen in iron deficiency anemia, which can be co-morbid with Crohn disease. While this patient does have recurrent gastrointestinal blood loss, the very low frequency of his symptoms is unlikely to result in iron deficiency, making a decreased MCV less likely compared to an increased MCV given the underlying terminal ileum pathology.\n\nAnswer B: Decreased serum homocysteine level is not seen in any common human disease. An elevated (not decreased) serum homocysteine level is seen in vitamin B12 deficiency in addition to folate deficiency. This increase is due to the impaired processing of homocysteine in the absence of these cofactors.\n\nAnswer D: Microcytes would not be seen in vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency, which instead present with macro-ovalocytes. Microcytic anemia would be seen in patients with iron deficiency anemia, which can present with fatigue and pallor in patients with occult bleeding. Iron supplementation and treatment of the underlying source of bleeding is appropriate care.\n\nAnswer E: A prolonged PTT could be seen in this patient as vitamin K absorption is likely affected. This patient is not presenting with a chief complaint of bruising/bleeding (the physical exam finding is erythema nodosum rather than ecchymosis), and symptoms point toward a diagnosis of anemia which would be associated with poor B12 absorption.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCrohn disease may affect the terminal ileum, resulting in vitamin B12 deficiency (increasing the serum methylmalonic acid level) that would present with macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia with hypersegmented neutrophils on a peripheral blood smear.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 15-year-old boy with a history of recurrent abdominal pain, blood in stool, weight loss, and now has conjunctival pallor. The CT shows terminal ileum involvement. The options are about lab findings related to anemia or coagulation.\n\nFirst, the key points: chronic abdominal issues with blood in stool, weight loss, pallor (which suggests anemia). The terminal ileum is involved. The terminal ileum is where vitamin B12 and folate are absorbed. So maybe a deficiency in one of those?\n\nThe options given are A to E. Let's look at each:\n\nA) Decreased MCV: MCV is mean corpuscular volume. Low MCV indicates microcytic anemia, which is usually iron deficiency or thalassemia. But B12 and folate deficiencies cause macrocytic anemia (high MCV). Since he has blood in stool, maybe iron loss leading to microcytic anemia? But the pallor is there, so anemia. Wait, but the terminal ileum is where B12 is absorbed. If there's a problem there, like Crohn's disease (which can affect terminal ileum), then B12 deficiency. But the question is about lab findings. \n\nB) Decreased homocysteine: B12 and folate are needed for homocysteine metabolism. In deficiency, homocysteine would be high, not low. So decreased homocysteine would not be seen here. So B is probably not correct.\n\nC) Increased methylmalonic acid: Both B12 deficiency and intrinsic factor issues cause increased MMA. Since terminal ileum is involved, maybe B12 absorption is impaired. So C could be correct.\n\nD) Microcytes: Microcytic cells (small RBCs) are seen in iron deficiency or thalassemia. If the anemia is due to B12 (macrocytic), then MCV would be high, so microcytes (low MCV) would not be present. Unless there's concurrent iron deficiency. But the main issue here might be B12. However, the question is which is \"most likely\". The terminal ileum problem points more to B12/folate issues. So D might not be the answer.\n\nE) Prolonged PTT: That's a coagulation issue,",

The diagnosis can be confirmed with a non-contrast head CT. Non-contrast CT scan of the head is sufficient to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage if performed within 6 hours of symptom onset. If the head CT is negative but SAH is still suspected, a lumbar puncture can help confirm the diagnosis (demonstrating xanthochromia) or CT angiography can be performed. Patients should be admitted for neurosurgery and neuro-IR consultation and may require calcium channel blockers and possible intervention.\n\nMacdonald et. al review spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Note the hyperdensity in the sylvian fissures and basal cisterns.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CNS vascular endothelial dysfunction results in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, which typically presents with hypertension and encephalopathy.\n\nAnswer B: Dehydration and stress could explain a migraine headache or a tension headache. Migraine headaches are often pulsating and may be associated with aura.\n\nAnswer C: Hypersensitivity of the trigeminal nerve is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of migraine headache, and also could describe trigeminal neuralgia which presents with sudden and severe electrical pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve with minor stimulation.\n\nAnswer D: Muscular pain and strain describes a tension headache which presents with diffuse head pain that is mild and not localized.

She had a similar but shorter episode two days ago. The key points here are the sudden onset and the fact that it's the worst headache she's ever had. The physical exam shows neck pain with movement, which might suggest meningismus. Her blood pressure is elevated, which can sometimes be a sign in such cases.\n\nThe options given are CNS vascular endothelial dysfunction, dehydration/stress, trigeminal nerve hypersensitivity, muscular pain/strain, or a ruptured berry aneurysm. \n\nFirst, the classic \"thunderclap\" headache is a red flag. That's sudden onset, peaking within minutes. Ruptured aneurysms (option E) are a common cause of thunderclap headaches. The previous episode two days ago might be a warning leak, which is when a small amount of blood leaks before the full rupture. The neck pain could be due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) causing meningismus. The CT scan mentioned is non-contrast, and if it shows blood, that would confirm SAH from an aneurysm. \n\nOther options: dehydration and stress (B) might cause tension headaches, but they don't present as thunderclap. Trigeminal nerve issues (C) are more about migraines or neuralgia, which usually have different characteristics. Muscular pain (D) would be more gradual and related to neck strain. CNS vascular endothelial dysfunction (A) is a bit vague but not the immediate top concern here. \n\nSo the most likely answer is E, rupture of a berry aneurysm leading to SAH.

The disease can be associated with hyperparathyroidism, Gitelman syndrome, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and hemochromatosis. The patient will have a leukocyte count < 50,000/mm^3 on joint aspiration and positively birefringent, rhomboid-shaped cells on microscopy, which represent calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) crystals. On radiography, chondrocalcinosis can be found, which is the calcification of adjacent cartilaginous structures. Treatment is with indomethacin.\n\nSidari and Hill review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of gout and pseudogout. They discuss how diagnosis can be made with fluid microscopy. They recommend treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is polarized microscopy of joint fluid showing rhomboid-shaped crystals that are positively birefringent (red circles). These represent calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals seen in pseudogout.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Boutonniere deformity is characterized by proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint flexion and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint extension and is a common hand deformity of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by insidious onset of morning stiffness and pain that usually affects symmetric PIP and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints first. On joint aspiration, leukocyte count ranges from 5,000-50,000/mm^3, but rheumatoid arthritis would not explain the CPPD crystals. Treatment may include methotrexate.\n\nAnswer C: Heberden nodes are bony protuberances in the DIP joints, which are characteristic of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis presents with insidious onset of joint pain that worsens with activity and weight-bearing. On joint aspiration, the leukocyte count is < 2,000/mm^3.\n\nAnswer D: Juxta-articular osteoporosis is decreased bone density of the bone surrounding the joint space. It is a nonspecific sign that can be seen with many inflammatory joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or septic arthritis. Septic arthritis presents with mono-articular joint pain, erythema, and swelling. Joint aspiration will show a leukocyte count > 50,000/mm^3 and Gram stain may be positive.\n\nAnswer E: Tophi are deposits of urate crystals in the soft tissue, which are nearly pathognomonic for gout. Gout presents as acute, mono-articular joint pain with physical examination showing a red, inflamed joint (usually the first metatarsophalangeal, knee, or ankle joint). Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent urate crystals are seen in the joint fluid aspirate.

The main possibilities here are infection (septic arthritis), crystal-induced arthritis (like gout or pseudogout), or maybe reactive arthritis. Let's consider each.\n\nThe patient had a dental procedure three weeks ago. Dental procedures can sometimes lead to infective endocarditis, but he doesn't have a fever. However, septic arthritis could be from hematogenous spread. But the synovial fluid WBC is 30k, which is high. In septic arthritis, the WBC is usually over 50,000, but can be lower in some cases. However, the neutrophil percentage here is 85%, which is typical for infection. But the question is about the radiograph finding, so maybe it's pointing towards another cause.\n\nHe had a kidney stone six months ago. Kidney stones are associated with hyperuricemia, which can lead to gout. Gout is a crystal-induced arthritis with urate crystals. The synovial fluid in gout would show negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals under polarized light. The leukocyte count here is 30k, which is in the range for gout (usually 2-70k, but can be higher). Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, CPPD) would have rhomboid calcium pyrophosphate crystals, which are positively birefringent.

Tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to unregulated cell growth, leading to the formation of hamartomas in various locations. Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. They found that cardiac rhabdomyomas can lead to arrhythmia later in life. They recommended that infantile spasms in tuberous sclerosis be treated with vigabatrin but other seizure types should be treated similar to other epileptic disorders.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Glaucoma may occur in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by \"tram-track\" calcifications in the brain, port-wine stains of the face, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is supported with endocrine tests as well as genetic testing.\n\nAnswer E: Renal cell carcinoma is associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), which presents with tumors arising in multiple organs. Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Diagnosis of VHL is with genetic testing.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTuberous sclerosis has numerous manifestations including seizures, angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, renal angiomyolipoma, ash-leaf spots, mental retardation, and cardiac rhabdomyoma.",

Hypsarrhythmia is a specific EEG pattern associated with infantile spasms, which are a type of epilepsy. The description of her stiffening and spreading arms sounds like classic infantile spasm movements, maybe salaams or axial hypertonics.\n\nNow, the physical exam mentions hypopigmented macules and a thickened plaque on the lower back. Hypopigmented skin lesions make me think of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is known for skin findings like ash-leaf spots (hypopigmented) and shagreen patches. The plaque could be a fibrous plaque, which is another sign of TSC. \n\nThe question is asking which of the options is most associated with her condition. Let's look at the options:\n\nA) Cardiac rhabdomyoma: These are benign heart tumors seen in TSC, especially in infants. They often regress over time. So this is a possible association.\n\nB) Glaucoma: TSC can have eye manifestations like retinal hamartomas, but glaucoma isn't a primary association. Maybe more with neurofibromatosis?\n\nC) Optic glioma: That's more linked to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), not TSC.\n\nD) Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia: That's part of McCune-Albright syndrome, which also includes caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and endocrine issues. But the skin lesions here are hypopigmented, not caf\u00e9-au-lait, so maybe not.\n\nE) Renal cell carcinoma: TSC can have renal angiomyolipomas, but not RCC. RCC is more with von Hippel-Lindau or other conditions.\n\nSo the key here is TSC. The question is which of the options is linked. Cardiac rhabdomyoma (A) is a common finding in TSC. The other options don't fit as well. The hypopigmented macules and the plaque (maybe a fibrous plaque) are classic for TSC, and the seizures with hypsarrhythmia fit with the epilepsy seen in TSC.

But he has a history of gallstones, so maybe a complication like obstruction or pancreatitis? However, the options given don't include a lipase test for pancreatitis. \n\nThe options are CT abdomen/pelvis, CT chest, HIDA scan, RUQ ultrasound, or smoking cessation and follow-up. Let's think through each option. \n\nThe HIDA scan is used to evaluate gallbladder function, like in acute cholecystitis when the Murphy sign is positive, but since his Murphy sign is negative, maybe that's less likely. The RUQ ultrasound is good for gallstones, but he already had gallstones incidentally found before. However, maybe they need to check for something else like liver masses or other issues. But the question is about the next step. \n\nThe patient's weight loss and weakness could be due to malignancy, like pancreatic cancer, which might present with weight loss and abdominal pain. Alternatively, liver issues like cirrhosis from alcohol, but he's had elevated liver enzymes before. The hypertension could be related to chronic alcohol use or maybe something else. \n\nA CT of the abdomen and pelvis would be more comprehensive. It can check for liver lesions, pancreatic issues, metastatic disease, or other abdominal masses. Since he's had weight loss and the abdominal exam isn't showing acute issues, a CT might be better than an ultrasound, which is more limited. The RUQ ultrasound is more focused on the gallbl",

Initial laboratory studies should include a complete blood count and a pregnancy test. A patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability should be ascertained immediately as it determines the most appropriate next step in management. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable (hypotensive and tachycardic), a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam should be immediately performed to evaluate for intraperitoneal bleeding, and ob/gyn should be immediately consulted for emergent surgical intervention (e.g., salpingectomy or salpingotomy).

Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago, and she uses a copper IUD. The physical exam shows uterine and adnexal tenderness, and her vital signs are concerning: low blood pressure (79/50) and tachycardia (135). The lab results include a hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, which is low, indicating possible blood loss. The beta-hCG is 2,700 IU/L, which is positive, suggesting a possible pregnancy. Since she has an IUD in place, an ectopic pregnancy is a consideration here because copper IUDs can sometimes fail, leading to an ectopic.\n\nThe options given are CT, laparoscopy, methotrexate, repeat hCG, or transvaginal ultrasound. The question is asking for the next best step. \n\nFirst, considering the symptoms and the elevated hCG, an ectopic pregnancy is a top concern. The patient is hemodynamically unstable (hypotension, tachycardia, low hemoglobin), which might indicate internal bleeding. In such cases, immediate action is needed. \n\nTransvaginal ultrasound (option E) is typically the first-line imaging for evaluating a possible ectopic pregnancy, especially when hCG is elevated. It can help visualize the uterus and adnexa to see if there's a gestational sac in the uterus (which would rule out ectopic if present) or an adnexal mass. However, sometimes in ectopic pregnancies, especially if the hCG is not extremely high, the ultrasound might not show anything, but it's still the initial step.\n\nLaparoscopy (option B) is more invasive and is usually done if there's a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion with instability. Since she's already unstable, maybe they might go straight to surgery, but the question is about the next step after starting IV fluids. The standard approach is to do the ultrasound first to confirm the location. \n\nMethotrexate (option C) is used for ectopic pregnancies that are medically manageable (no rupture, low hCG, no symptoms of rupture).

SCD is a predisposing factor for avascular necrosis.\n\nAvascular necrosis has a multitude of direct causes, including irradiation, trauma (history of femoral neck fracture), hematologic diseases such as leukemia, SCD, and idiopathic etiology. In traumatic causes, injury to the medial femoral circumflex artery supplying the femoral head causes vascular disruption with resulting osteonecrosis. In SCD, the propensity for sickle-shaped erythrocytes to stick to one another and occlude blood vessels results in loss of circulation to the femoral head with consequent osteonecrosis. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head presents with insidious onset of anterior groin pain. The diagnosis can be secured with plain radiographs, although magnetic resonance imaging has the highest sensitivity and specificity for uncertain cases. Treatment consists of bisphosphonates with crutches (non-weight-bearing) and/or surgery depending on the degree of femoral head collapse and etiology.\n\nAkinyoola et al. studied the risk factors associated with avascular necrosis of the femoral head in patients with sickle cell disease. The authors found that the rate of pain crises and annual hospitalizations are associated with avascular necrosis. The authors recommend further study to explain differences in the prevalence of osteonecrosis in different populations with sickle cell disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows a plain radiograph of the left hip in a skeletally mature individual, demonstrating amorphous cortical lesions (red arrows) in the femoral head and cortical irregularity (blue arrow) typical of avascular necrosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Excess alcohol use has been associated with the risk of avascular necrosis. This patient uses alcohol in moderation (2 drinks or fewer per day for men) and has no history of alcohol use disorder.\n\nAnswer C: Lack of physical activity is a predisposing factor for osteoporosis but is not associated with avascular necrosis. Osteoporosis may increase the risk of a hip fracture, which would present with a painful, shortened, and externally rotated lower extremity.\n\nAnswer D: Low BMI is not a predisposing factor for avascular necrosis. In contrast, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of avascular necrosis.\n\nAnswer E: Scuba diving can indirectly predispose patients to avascular necrosis through decompression sickness (Caisson Disease). In decompression, dissolved gases in the arterial supply form gas emboli, leading to microvascular occlusion and dysbaric osteonecrosis. However, this patient\u2019s symptoms have been present for 1 year whereas he only recently began scuba diving.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSickle cell disease is a predisposing factor for avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which presents as insidious anterior groin pain.",

The pain is 8/10 when climbing stairs or getting up from sitting. He localizes it to the front of the groin. No redness or swelling. His history includes hypertension, sickle cell anemia, and a splenectomy. He drinks a glass of wine daily and started scuba diving two months ago but doesn't exercise much. Vital signs are normal except maybe the low BMI of 18.1.\n\nThe physical exam shows pain at the end ranges of hip abduction and internal rotation, no point tenderness. The X-ray is mentioned but we can't see it. The question is asking which part of his history most predisposes him to this condition.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what condition this might be. The symptoms are groin pain, especially with movements like climbing stairs. The location is the front of the groin. The physical exam findings of pain at the terminal ranges of hip abduction and internal rotation make me think of something related to the hip joint or surrounding structures. Since there's no erythema or swelling, it's probably not an infection or inflammation like cellulitis. The X-ray might show something like a stress fracture, avascular necrosis, or maybe a hernia, but the movements involved suggest a hip issue.\n\nNow, considering his history: sickle cell anemia is a big one. Sickle cell can lead to avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head because the sickled cells can block blood flow, leading to bone death. AVN can cause groin pain, especially with weight-bearing movements. The patient's history of splenectomy is part of sickle cell management (since they often do splenectomies in sickle cell patients due to sequestration crises), but the key here is the sickle cell itself.\n\nScuba diving could be a factor. Decompression sickness (the bends) occurs when nitrogen bubbles form in the blood after rapid ascent. This can cause joint pain, but typically in larger joints like shoulders, knees, hips. However, the timing here is that he started scuba diving two months ago, and the pain started a year ago. So maybe not the immediate cause, but could it be a contributing factor? Maybe, but the duration doesn't align as well.\n\nHypertension might not be directly related here. The low BMI (18",

In patients without significant trauma, the presence of signs of spinal cord compression (e.g., urinary retention, bowel incontinence, saddle anesthesia, focal neurologic deficits), history of or strong risk factors for cancer, signs of infection, or risk of vertebral compression fracture should prompt additional work-up with imaging such as radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging. If none of these findings are present (most patients with acute low back pain in the primary care setting), then conservative therapy for 4-6 weeks consisting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with or without physical therapy is indicated.\n\nPatel and Ogle review the management of acute low back pain in the primary care setting. They outline the Waddell signs, which indicate the presence of a functional (signs of excessive pain behavior) aspect of pain. The authors recommend surgical evaluation only in patients with worsening neurologic deficits or intractable pain resistant to conservative treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Herniated discs occurs when the nucleus pulposus herniates through a weakened part of the annulus fibrosus of an intervertebral disc, resulting in spinal nerve root compression. This causes radicular findings at the level of compression, including weakness in hip abduction and ankle dorsiflexion with L5 involvement and weakness in ankle plantarflexion and reduced Achilles reflex with S1 involvement, and radiation of pain into the ipsilateral lower extremity. The straight leg raise test would be positive, as it exacerbates the nerve root compression.\n\nAnswer C: Multiple myeloma presents with hypercalcemia, anemia, renal failure, and lytic bone lesions causing bone pain. This patient has no constitutional symptoms to suggest a malignant process and has a mild elevation in serum calcium, which is likely due to her thiazide diuretic. The clear association of her back pain with exertion makes lumbosacral strain more likely.\n\nAnswer D: Spondylolisthesis occurs when a vertebral body is forwardly subluxated relative to the adjacent vertebral body. This presents as back pain alleviated by rest. Since this can narrow the spinal canal, it may also present with neurogenic claudication, manifesting as buttock or leg pain with walking that can be alleviated by bending forward. This patient\u2019s back pain is not alleviated by rest and is associated with exertion.\n\nAnswer E: Vertebral compression fractures can present as back pain in a patient with minor or no trauma. These patients have osteoporosis and other risk factors like advanced age or chronic corticosteroid use and would have point tenderness at the site of fracture. This patient does not have point tenderness or risk factors.\n\nBullet Summary:\nLumbosacral strain is a common cause of acute low back pain that presents after physical exertion with no radicular signs and a negative straight leg raise test.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 60-year-old woman with back pain after gardening. The pain is 7/10, non-radiating, not relieved by rest. She has no history of similar pain, and no fever, night sweats, weight loss, or bowel/bladder issues. She has hypertension on hydrochlorothiazide and recently had an asthma flare treated with prednisone. No alcohol or smoking. Vital signs are normal except for a slightly elevated heart rate (90). On exam, no tenderness over the spine. The straight leg raise test (which I think is what they're referring to with hip flexion with knee extended) is negative, as is the Lasegue's sign (dorsiflexion at hip extension). Strength is 5/5 in all tested muscles, reflexes are 2+ and equal. Labs: Hb 12, creatinine 1.1, Ca 10.6.\n\nHmm, the question is asking for the most likely diagnosis. The options are herniated disc, lumbosacral strain, multiple myeloma, spondylolisthesis, or vertebral compression fracture.\n\nFirst, let's consider her risk factors. She's 60, which is postmenopausal, so osteoporosis is a consideration. She had a recent course of prednisone, which can also contribute to bone weakening. Vertebral compression fractures are common in osteoporosis, especially with minor trauma like gardening. The pain is severe (7/10) and not relieved by rest, which fits with a fracture. The absence of tenderness on palpation might be a bit confusing, but sometimes fractures can present without significant tenderness. However, the straight leg raise is negative, which would argue against a herniated disc causing nerve irritation. Herniated discs usually have radiation of pain or neurological deficits, which she doesn't have. Spondylolisthesis is a slippage of a vertebra, but that's more associated with back pain and possibly neuro symptoms, but again, her exam doesn't show that. Lumbosacral strain is possible, but the severity and the fact that she's on prednisone (which can cause bone issues) makes me think of a fracture. \n\nWait, the calcium level is 10.6, which is slightly elevated but not super high. Multiple myeloma can cause hypercalcemia",

The vomitus looks like breast milk. The patient\u2019s mother is exclusively breastfeeding and would prefer not to switch to formula but worries that the patient is not getting the nutrition he needs. Two weeks ago, the patient was in the 75th percentile for weight and 70th for height. He is now in the 60th percentile for weight and 68th percentile for height.

The most appropriate next step in management is abdominal ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nPyloric stenosis presents in 4- to 6-week-old infants with nonbilious, post-prandial projectile vomiting. Although pyloric stenosis classically presents with an \u201colive-shaped\u201d mass in the epigastrium, the mass cannot be palpated in some patients. Any infant who develops new, persistent vomiting in the first 2 months of life and has associated dehydration or failure to thrive should undergo an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for pyloric stenosis. Patients should undergo resuscitation prior to the definitive treatment, which is a pyloromyotomy.\n\nAdams and Stanton review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal bowel obstruction. They discuss how malrotation, jejunoileal atresia, duodenal atresia, and colonic atresia are common causes of this finding. They recommend surgical management of these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal radiograph is not helpful in evaluating for pyloric stenosis. It is more useful in the workup of bilious vomiting, as several etiologies of bilious vomiting (such as duodenal atresia and Hirschsprung disease) can be seen on an abdominal radiograph. Treatment of these conditions is surgical excision of the defective segment of colon.\n\nAnswer C: Supplementing breastfeeding with formula would not be appropriate for this patient as his failure to thrive is driven by gastric outlet obstruction. In the case of pyloric stenosis, formula would cause vomiting just as breastmilk does.\n\nAnswer D: A trial of a dairy-free diet is used to improve gastroesophageal reflux, but in the setting of this patient\u2019s age and the description of vomiting, he should undergo an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for pyloric stenosis. Treatment of reflux also involves positional changes during feeding.\n\nAnswer E: A trial of empiric proton pump inhibitor is indicated for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, but it would not address this patient\u2019s pyloric stenosis. Patients can also undergo conservative treatments such as changing positioning during feeding.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe diagnostic test of choice for pyloric stenosis in infants is an abdominal ultrasound.",

The mom is breastfeeding, and they tried changing the feeding frequency and amount, but it's getting worse. The baby's weight has dropped from 75th to 60th percentile, which is a concern. The physical exam shows dry mucous membranes, which suggests dehydration. The abdomen is soft and non-distended, so maybe not an obstruction? The question is asking for the next step in management.\n\nFirst, I need to think about possible causes of vomiting in a newborn. Common ones include things like gastroesophageal reflux, pyloric stenosis, infections, or maybe something like Hirschsprung's disease. But given the age, pyloric stenosis usually presents around 2-4 weeks, and the classic symptom is projectile vomiting. However, in this case, the vomitus is just breast milk, not bile or anything else. The abdomen is soft, so maybe not pyloric stenosis. \n\nThe baby is losing weight, so nutrition is an issue. The mother wants to continue breastfeeding but is worried. The options given are abdominal radiograph, ultrasound, supplement with formula, dairy-free diet, or a proton pump inhibitor trial.\n\nLet me go through each option. \n\nOption A: Abdominal radiograph. Well, an X-ray might show some issues like obstruction, but in a newborn with non-bilious vomiting and a soft abdomen, maybe not the first step. Also, radiation exposure in a baby is a consideration. \n\nOption B: Abdominal ultrasound. That's better for looking at structures like the pylorus (for pyloric stenosis) or other anatomical issues. If they suspect something like pyloric stenosis, an ultrasound is the go-to. But the question is, does the presentation fit that? The baby is 4 weeks old, which is the right age. But the description doesn't mention projectile vomiting, which is typical. However, maybe the parents didn't describe it as projectile. The abdomen is soft, but pyloric stenosis can have a soft abdomen unless the muscle is really thick. So maybe an ultrasound is needed here. \n\nOption C: Supplement with formula. Since the baby is losing weight and vomiting after every feed, maybe they need to ensure adequate nutrition. If breastfeeding isn't working, adding formula could help.

        "reason": "This patient with likely gastroenteritis (given his nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) is dehydrated, as indicated by his low blood pressure, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and prerenal kidney injury (elevated BUN and creatinine with BUN:creatinine ratio > 20:1) in the setting of an anion gap (anion gap = [Na+] - [Cl-] - [HCO3-] = 147 - 112 - 14 = 21). His elevated troponin is likely secondary to poor renal clearance and dehydration, which is most appropriately addressed with IV fluids such as Ringer lactate.\n\nTroponin is a lab marker classically thought to be elevated when there is an injury to the heart causing leakage of this enzyme from the cardiac myocyte. However, there are many possible causes of an elevated troponin that may not be directly cardiac in nature or related to myocardial ischemia. Acute kidney injury is a common cause of an elevated troponin. For this reason, patients with an elevated troponin with kidney dysfunction without any cardiac symptoms or ECG changes should have their renal etiology addressed, and this will often clear the troponin. In the setting of a prerenal injury (dehydration causing poor kidney perfusion and a BUN:creatinine ratio > 20:1), IV fluids will restore perfusion and treat the underlying cause. Patients with chronic kidney disease or kidney failure should have an ECG obtained and their current troponin should be compared to previous troponin levels to ensure it is not higher than their baseline. If there is uncertainty regarding a troponin level, it can be trended to see if it is rising, falling, or staying the same. Correlation with clinical symptoms is important when evaluating an elevated troponin level.\n\nMasri et al. review the causes of an elevated troponin. They note that a troponin elevation can be seen in myopericarditis, renal failure, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, rhabdomyolysis, stroke, and many other possible causes that are not related to myocardial infarction. They recommend keeping a broad differential and correlating the troponin with the patient's clinical presentation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aspirin would be appropriate management of an elevated troponin secondary to acute coronary syndrome as its antiplatelet activity reduces mortality. It should be administered prior to performing an ECG in patients with chest pain thought to be from a cardiac etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, and cardiac catheterization is appropriate management of a ST elevation myocardial infarction, which presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea, and ST elevation within a vascular distribution with reciprocal changes on ECG. This patient has no cardiac symptoms and has a better alternative explanation for their troponin elevation.\n\nAnswer C: Metoprolol and aspirin may be indicated in acute coronary syndrome, and metoprolol would reduce this patient's heart rate. However, note that this patient's tachycardia is secondary to volume depletion; thus, beta-blockade for sinus tachycardia is inappropriate and may make the patient hemodynamically unstable.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a urinalysis and creatine phosphokinase level may be performed in rhabdomyolysis which presents in the setting of seizures, electrical shock, heatstroke, or with vigorous exertion. Patients will complain of muscle pain, oliguria, and dark urine. Management is centered on the administration of large volumes of fluid to protect the kidney and clear the toxic myoglobin. Note that rhabdomyolysis may elevate the troponin; however, there is nothing in this patient's history that suggests rhabdomyolysis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPrerenal injury causing an acute kidney injury may elevate the troponin due to decreased renal clearance and should be addressed with the administration of fluids.",

His labs show an elevated troponin of 0.10, which is way above the normal value of <0.01. The question is about the most appropriate management for his elevated troponin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why his troponin is elevated. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a stent placed a year ago. The elevated troponin could indicate an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), like a myocardial infarction. However, he doesn't have chest pain or dyspnea, which are common symptoms. But sometimes, especially in elderly patients or those with diabetes, symptoms can be atypical. The confusion might be due to dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea, but the elevated BUN and creatinine (2.1) suggest possible dehydration leading to prerenal azotemia. However, the troponin is still a concern.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Aspirin: Aspirin is a first-line treatment for ACS, but maybe not enough on its own.\n\nB) Aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, and cardiac catheterization: This sounds like a full ACS workup, especially with a stent history. The patient might be having a stent thrombosis, which is a serious condition requiring urgent intervention.\n\nC) Metoprolol and aspirin: Beta-blockers are used in ACS, but again, maybe not the full treatment here. Also, if the patient has a stent, maybe they need more aggressive management.\n\nD) Urinalysis and CPK: CPK might check for muscle damage, but troponin is a specific cardiac marker. Not sure if this is the priority here.\n\nE) Ringer lactate bolus: This addresses dehydration, which is part of his presentation. But the question specifically asks about managing the elevated troponin, not the dehydration. However, treating dehydration could help if the troponin is due to hypoperfusion (like a type II MI from demand ischemia). But the elevated troponin is significant, so maybe the priority is to rule out ACS.\n\nThe patient's BUN is 80, which is high, and creatinine is up, so dehydration is likely contributing.

Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers.

Ulcerative colitis presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients can also experience musculoskeletal pain, uveitis, and dermatologic findings such as erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum.

Ibuprofen is a NSAID, which can cause ulcers, but he took it with food, which might have mitigated some risk. However, he's been using it and it helped, so maybe the underlying issue is something else.\n\nThe positive stool guaiac indicates occult blood. That could be from an ulcer bleeding, but also other causes like colorectal cancer, but the pain location is more upper GI. The patient drinks alcohol on weekends and has a smoking history, which are risk factors for ulcers and other GI issues.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Crypt abscesses in the large intestine: That's more like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's, but the pain is epigastric, not typically where the large intestine is. Also, the stool guaiac could be from upper GI bleeding, but crypt abscesses are in the colon.\n\nB) Mucosal defect in the stomach: A gastric ulcer would fit. The pain is epigastric, improves with eating (since food neutralizes acid), and NSAIDs can cause ulcers. The positive stool guaiac could be from an ulcer bleeding. But the question mentions the biopsy is from the endoscopy. Gastric ulcers would show mucosal defects.\n\nC) Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine: That's Crohn's disease. But Crohn's can affect any part of the GI tract, but the location here is more stomach/doudenum. Also, the symptoms don't mention diarrhea or weight loss, which are more common in Crohn's.\n\nD) PAS-positive material in the small intestine: PAS staining is used for things like amyloid or certain infections.

Common etiologies include idiopathic, post-viral, post-cardiac surgery, post-radiation, tuberculosis-related, or connective tissue disorder-related. It presents as right heart failure including symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain relieved by leaning forward, progressive peripheral edema, and ascites. A physical exam will identify an early diastolic pericardial knock, pericardial calcifications on chest radiograph, and jugular venous distension (JVD). Kussmaul sign can also occur where the JVD paradoxically rises during inspiration instead of falling. The diagnosis is supported with echocardiography. Management may require pericardiectomy for severe cases.\n\nWelch and Oh review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of constrictive pericarditis. They discuss how this disease can be evaluated using a cardiac MRI. They recommend surgical pericardiectomy in many cases.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a frontal chest radiograph with pericardial calcifications (red circle). These findings are consistent with constrictive pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can present similarly to constrictive pericarditis. Hypotension and pulsus paradoxus (a greater than 10 mmHg decrease in the systolic blood pressure during inspiration), will commonly present in patients with cardiac tamponade. A chest radiograph will show an enlarged cardiac silhouette rather than calcifications in some cases. Treatment is with emergent pericardial decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Cirrhosis can present with ascites and peripheral edema, but will not have a marked elevation in jugular venous pressure. Cirrhosis is the end-stage result of many hepatic pathologies. Treatment is with the control of sequelae such as hepatic encephalopathy and venous congestion.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, like constrictive pericarditis, can present with exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and peripheral edema if it progresses to right ventricular failure. A chest radiograph may show enlarged central pulmonary arteries and peripheral pulmonary vessels. Treatment is with reduction of pulmonary pressure such as with endothelin inhibitors.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy can also present as right heart failure with similar symptoms to constrictive pericarditis. A history of an infiltrative disease (e.g., amyloidosis and sarcoidosis) often favors restrictive cardiomyopathy, as does an audible S3 on a physical exam. Calcification of the pericardium on the chest radiograph is more consistent with constrictive pericarditis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nConstrictive pericarditis presents with symptoms of right heart failure, progressive peripheral edema, ascites, jugular venous distension, pericardial knock, and pericardial calcifications on a chest radiograph.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 62-year-old man with chest pain and worsening dyspnea over two months, starting after a flu. His current symptoms include difficulty breathing even at rest, and physical exam shows jugular venous distension (JVD) both during inspiration and expiration, abdominal distention, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The options given are Cardiac tamponade, Cirrhosis, Constrictive pericarditis, Pulmonary arterial hypertension, and Restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each option and see which fits best with the symptoms and exam findings. Let's start by recalling the key features of each condition.\n\nCardiac tamponade typically presents with Beck's triad: muffled heart sounds, hypotension (pulsus paradoxus), and JVD. The patient here has JVD, but his blood pressure is 130/78, which isn't low. Also, tamponade usually causes more acute symptoms, especially if it's due to recent trauma or pericarditis. The onset here was after the flu two months ago, so maybe not acute enough for tamponade unless there's a chronic process, but the BP is normal, so maybe less likely.\n\nCirrhosis would present with ascites, edema, and JVD, but the JVD in cirrhosis is usually due to elevated right atrial pressure from liver disease. However, the patient's history includes hypertension, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The medications include sulfasalazine, which is used for RA. Cirrhosis might be possible, but the chest X-ray (though we can't see it) might show other signs. Also, the dyspnea and chest pain might not be the primary presentation of cirrhosis unless there's something else like hepatopulmonary syndrome, but that's less common.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis is a condition where the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic, often after pericarditis (which can be caused by infections like viral, maybe post-flu in this case). The key features are equal JVD during inspiration and expiration (since in normal respiration, JVD decreases during inspiration; in constrictive pericarditis, it doesn't), which the patient has. Also, there's edema and ascites. The progression over months fits with chronic pericardial constr",

The most common symptoms are Raynaud phenomenon (vascular hyper-reactivity that presents with burning/pain in the hands where the hands change color from white to blue to red, seen in Figure A), arthralgias, myalgias, dysphagia, and edema of the hands. Anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibodies are commonly found in mixed connective tissue disease and are a specific marker. In this disease, there is typically an absence of renal involvement.

Treatment is with hydroxychloroquine.\n\nAnswer B: Anti-IgG Fc region is representative of rheumatoid factor which is found in rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis can present with fever, weight loss, and joint pain that worsens in the morning and improves with activity. It is common for the joints of the hands to become deformed due to the disease process. Treatment is with methotrexate.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are likely positive in this patient; however, they are not more likely to aid in making the diagnosis than anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies are.

Given his poor CNS perfusion (somnolence during his tachycardia despite a \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure), the most appropriate next step in management is cardioversion.\n\nWolff Parkinson White syndrome (WPW) is a pre-excitation syndrome where an accessory electrical pathway exists between the atria and ventricles that bypasses the AV node. WPW can demonstrate antidromic conduction where the accessory pathway leads to anterograde conduction causing a wide-complex tachycardia that is often mistaken for ventricular tachycardia. In this circumstance, the QRS is wide and a delta wave is often present but may be difficult to discern. If ever uncertain as to whether the diagnosis is ventricular tachycardia or WPW, cardioversion is a safe and effective intervention for both rhythms. Unstable patients with either WPW or ventricular tachycardia should undergo cardioversion immediately. Other treatments for WPW in stable patients may include procainamide. Ablation may present future episodes.\n\nBartlett and Friedman review the pathophysiology of WPW. They discuss the congenital presence of impulse-conducting fascicles leading to this condition.

SVT presents as a narrow complex tachycardia without P waves. It is regular (in contrast to atrial fibrillation). Failure to respond to vagal maneuvers or adenosine warrants cardioversion. If this patient was perfusing his CNS, a trial of adenosine could be appropriate given it has a short half-life and may differentiate ventricular tachycardia from SVT with aberrancy or a bundle branch block.\n\nAnswer B: Amiodarone may be used in stable ventricular tachycardia to control the rhythm and convert it to sinus. It would not be appropriate in a hemodynamically unstable patient. It can be used in other dysrhythmias as well including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.\n\nAnswer D: Defibrillation is only indicated in pulseless, shockable rhythms including ventricular fibrillation (disorganized electrical activity), pulseless ventricular tachycardia (wide complex tachycardia), and pulseless torsades des pointes (twisting of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric baseline). It could cause cardiac arrest if performed on a patient with a pulse.\n\nAnswer E: Procainamide is an antidysrhythmic that can be used in tachydysrhythmias that occur in WPW.

Clinical features of polymyositis include symmetric proximal muscle weakness that may be accompanied by myalgia, dysphagia (due to pharyngeal muscle weakness), restrictive lung disease (due to respiratory muscle weakness), cardiac involvement (myocarditis, heart failure), interstitial lung disease, and increased risk of malignancy. There are no accepted diagnostic criteria for polymyositis; however, diagnosis is usually secured with a combination of clinical features and other tests. Routine initial studies can include a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, creatine kinase, autoantibodies (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Jo-1), and electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy of an affected muscle is the gold standard for diagnosis and will typically show muscle fiber damage, CD8+ T cells in the endomysium, and overexpression of MHC-I on the sarcolemma. First-line treatment of polymyositis includes glucocorticoids and a steroid-sparing agent (methotrexate, azathioprine). Subsequent treatments can include intravenous immunoglobulins, rituximab, or plasmapheresis.\n\nAmato et al. review the evaluation and treatment of inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis. They found that polymyositis typically presents in adult life with symmetric proximal leg greater than arm weakness. They recommend that a muscle biopsy be done on any patient considered to have polymyositis, preferably prior to starting immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Electromyography (EMG) can help distinguish myopathic weakness (e.g., polymyositis) from neuropathic causes of weakness (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis). Characteristic EMG findings include fibrillations, early recruitment of motor unit potentials, and abnormal low-amplitude motor unit potentials. EMG is not a confirmatory test and is less sensitive than muscle biopsy for diagnosing myositis.\n\nAnswer B: MRI can be used to demonstrate areas of edema, atrophy, fatty replacement, and calcification in patients with suspected polymyositis. MRI can assess large regions of muscle, thus avoiding sampling error with muscle biopsy. The findings in MRI are nonspecific and require correlation with muscle biopsy for definitive diagnosis. MRI can also be used to help select the site of muscle biopsy.\n\nAnswer D: Serum aldolase can occasionally be used in the diagnostic investigation of suspected polymyositis if creatine kinase is normal. Aldolase elevation is nonspecific and may be seen in fasciitis, drug-induced myositis, and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease.\n\nAnswer E: Serum creatine kinase (CK) is the most sensitive muscle enzyme exam and should be part of the initial diagnostic investigation of any patient with suspected polymyositis. CK elevation is nonspecific and may be seen in myriad conditions such as inflammatory insult, metabolic injury, drug-induced injury, and infection.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMuscle biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of polymyositis.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 53-year-old African-American woman with progressive muscle weakness over three months. The symptoms include difficulty climbing stairs, combing hair, standing up, and muscle aches. Her medical history has hypertension and GERD. On exam, her strength is 3/5 in shoulder abduction and hip flexion, but 5/5 in wrist extension and ankle plantar flexion. No rash. The question is asking for the most accurate test to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the possible diagnosis is here. The pattern of weakness might be key. Shoulder abduction and hip flexion are proximal muscles, so this sounds like proximal muscle weakness. The distal muscles (wrist and ankle) are normal, which suggests a myopathy rather than a neuropathy. Myopathies can be inflammatory, metabolic, or genetic. The muscle aches could point towards an inflammatory myopathy like polymyositis or dermatomyositis. But there's no rash mentioned, which is common in dermatomyositis, so maybe polymyositis?\n\nAlternatively, could it be something like inclusion body myositis? But that usually has more distal weakness too. Maybe a metabolic myopathy? But the question is about confirming the diagnosis. The options given are EMG, MRI, muscle biopsy, serum aldolase, and creatine kinase.\n\nThe standard initial tests for suspected myopathy are serum muscle enzymes. CK is the most common one. Aldolase is another enzyme, but CK is more specific for muscle damage. Inflammatory myopathies like polymyositis typically have elevated CK levels. So the first step would be checking CK. If that's elevated, then further tests like EMG, MRI, or biopsy might be needed. But the question is asking for the most accurate test to confirm the diagnosis. \n\nWait, the options include muscle biopsy, which is considered the gold standard for diagnosing myopathies. However, the question might be looking for the initial test. But the wording says \"confirm the diagnosis.\" If the diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and CK is elevated, then biopsy would confirm. But maybe the question is looking for the best confirmatory test. Let me think again.\n\nThe options are (A) EMG, (B) MRI, (C) muscle biopsy, (D) aldolase, (E) CK. \n\nIn the context of the question, the most accurate test to confirm",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with both absence seizures (periods of inattentiveness in school) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (abnormal, involuntary spasms of her upper extremity). The most appropriate treatment for these conditions is valproic acid.\n\nAbsence seizures classically present with cessation of motor activity and speech with a blank facial expression and occasionally automatisms such as flickering of the eyelids. They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer. It carries the potentially severe side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is not a first-line treatment for absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Stevens-Johnson syndrome will present with painful desquamation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAbsence seizures present with periods of inattentiveness and subtle automatisms and are most appropriately treated with ethosuximide or with valproic acid if there is concurrent juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 16-year-old girl from Bolivia with inattentiveness in school, described as daydreaming episodes where she doesn't respond. The mother mentions that upon waking, the patient's arm jerks back and forth involuntarily. The key here is to figure out what's causing these episodes.\n\nFirst, the symptoms: the daydreaming episodes and the arm jerking. The fact that the arm movements happen upon awakening and are not intentional suggests a possible seizure disorder. The term \"daydreaming\" could be non-epileptic, but combined with the jerking, it's worth considering absence seizures. Absence seizures typically present with staring spells, sometimes with automatisms like blinking or small movements. The arm jerking might be myoclonic seizures, which are quick muscle jerks. However, myoclonic seizures are more common in certain types of epilepsy like juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). \n\nJuvenile myoclonic epilepsy often starts around puberty and includes myoclonic jerks in the morning, along with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and possibly absence seizures. The patient's episodes of inattention could be absence seizures, and the arm movements myoclonic jerks. That would point towards a diagnosis of JME. \n\nNow, the treatment options. The choices are antiepileptics: carbamazepine, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, valproic acid. Ethosuximide is mainly for absence seizures. Valproic acid is broad-spectrum and used for absence, myoclonic, and generalized seizures. Lamotrigine is also used for various epilepsies, including JME. Carbamazepine is more for partial seizures or generalized tonic-clonic but might not be first-line here. \n\nSince JME often requires a drug that controls both absence and myoclonic seizures, valproic acid is typically first-line because it covers all generalized seizures. Ethosuximide wouldn't cover the myoclonic component. Lamotrigine is another option but valproic is more standard. So the answer is probably E (Valproic acid). Wait, but let me check again. The question says \"initial treatment\". For JME, valproate is indeed first-line. So the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\n\nE",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

The patient is a 31-year-old man with a history of HIV, low CD4 count (40/mm\u00b3) five weeks ago, and he was treated for a right upper lobe infiltrate. Now he's back with similar symptoms: fever, malaise, cough with blood, and a new chest X-ray showing nodules in the left upper lobe and hilar adenopathy. His CD4 count had bounced back to over 400 after treatment, and his viral load is now negligible. \n\nFirst, I need to consider what's going on here. The key points are the recurrence of symptoms and the new imaging findings. Since he had a previous episode treated appropriately, but now has a new infiltrate in a different lobe, this could be a relapse or a new infection. But his CD4 count is now high, which usually means his immune system is better. However, the rapid recurrence might suggest something else.\n\nWait, the CD4 went from 40 to over 400 in four weeks after starting antiretrovirals. That's a significant increase, which is good. But the new symptoms and imaging could indicate a different process. The presence of nodules and hilar adenopathy makes me think of opportunistic infections that might occur even with a recovering CD4 count, but maybe something like Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or another atypical mycobacterial infection? Or maybe an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)?\n\nIRIS is a possibility here. When the immune system recovers quickly, sometimes it can overreact to a pre-existing infection, leading to worsening symptoms even though the pathogen is being controlled. The patient was treated before, but now with a better immune system, maybe his body is fighting the residual infection more aggressively, causing the new nodules and symptoms. That would explain why the CD4 is up, but he's having a flare-up.\n\nIf it's IRIS, the management would involve continuing the antiretroviral therapy and possibly adding high-dose glucocorticoids to suppress the inflammation. The options here include option E: start high-dose glucocorticoids and discontinue antiretroviral therapy. Wait, but discontinuing ART is bad because that would let HIV rebound.

This ego defense method is suggestive of intellectualization.\n\nIntellectualization typically occurs in patients who have received a very stressful diagnosis or bad news for a close loved one. They will often focus on the science and research of their disease rather than focus on emotionally processing this stressful event. This is a way of distancing themselves from the diagnosis and their circumstances. These patients may have difficulty connecting with others because they become extremely focused on data.\n\nArnold reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis of intellectualization. He discusses how this term can either refer to the isolation of affect or the general use of reason. He recommends a better understanding of how this ego defense works.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Dissociation is the detachment of the mind from the emotional state/body. A more specific diagnosis for this patient would be intellectualization as he is detaching himself from the emotional state of the diagnosis and instead focusing on the science behind his condition.\n\nAnswer C: Optimism is trying to find the best in a bad situation. This patient's focus on treatment outcomes and absence of emotion suggests intellectualization as the employed defense mechanism. Patients who are optimistic will still be able to emotionally process information.\n\nAnswer D: Pessimism is finding the worst in most situations. Pessimism would be a possible answer if the patient had a very treatable disease but thought that poor outcomes would occur regardless.\n\nAnswer E: Rationalization is the use of logic or reasoning (that can be inappropriate) in order to substantiate one's behavior even when it is inappropriate.

The question is about which defense mechanism he's exhibiting.\n\nThe options are Dissociation, Intellectualization, Optimism, Pessimism, or Rationalization. \n\nFirst, let's recall what each term means. Dissociation is when someone disconnects from reality, like feeling detached or in a dream. That doesn't seem to fit here because he's actively discussing literature and studies, so he's engaged, not detached.\n\nIntellectualization is when someone deals with emotional stress by focusing on rational and factual information, avoiding the emotional aspect. The patient is talking about current literature, novel therapies, and calculating his mortality using a study. That sounds like he's using factual data to distance himself from the emotional impact of his diagnosis.\n\nOptimism would be him focusing on positive outcomes or hoping for the best, but the question mentions he's calculating his likely mortality, which is more about facing facts in a detached way rather than being hopeful. Pessimism is expecting the worst, but he's not necessarily being negative; he's analyzing data. Rationalization is justifying actions or feelings with logical reasons, which doesn't fit here either.\n\nSo, the best fit is Intellectualization. The answer should be B.\n</think>\n\nB",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with major depressive disorder but has not given his current selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) at least 4 weeks to begin working. Thus, he should be reassured and maintained on the current dose of his SSRI, with follow-up after the 4 week mark to see if his symptoms have improved.\n\nMajor depressive disorder is managed initially with cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. The typical first-line medication is an SSRI. SSRIs may take at least 4 weeks or more to begin working, so patients that return before this time period should be reassured and encouraged to let the medication take effect as long as they are not experiencing suicidal thoughts or intent. If the medication is not working after at least 4 weeks, the next steps in management could include increasing the dose of the current medication, changing SSRIs, adding another antidepressant agent, or adding a low dose of levothyroxine. All patients with suicidal ideation and either intent or a plan to hurt themselves should be hospitalized involuntarily.\n\nGautam et al. discuss the current management algorithms for major depressive disorder. They note different options including CBT and pharmacotherapy. They recommend appropriate treatment with a first-line agent based on the patient and their circumstances.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering levothyroxine is appropriate as an augmenting agent in patients who do not have an improvement in symptoms on SSRIs or other antidepressants even if their TSH is within the normal range. However, it would not be attempted at this point given this patient has not given his current medication sufficient time to begin working. There is limited evidence to support its use overall. Note that this patient's TSH is within normal limits. In some cases, T3 administration is used in refractory depression.\n\nAnswer B: Changing the medication to bupropion could be appropriate in patients who want to avoid weight gain, those who want to quit smoking, or those who are trying to avoid sexual side effects. It also is an appropriate second-line agent or could be added to a first-line agent; however, this patient\u2019s current medication should be tried for at least 4 weeks before changing medications.\n\nAnswers 3 & 4: Changing medication to escitalopram or increasing the dose of the current medication are both viable strategies if a patient has failed to improve on their first medication after at least 4 weeks on the medication. Increasing the dose early may lead to symptoms of serotonin excess when the drug takes effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSSRIs are the first-line agents in the management of major depressive disorder and should be tried for at least 4 weeks before changing the treatment regimen.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 55-year-old man with persistent depressive symptoms despite being on fluoxetine for three weeks. His other meds include albuterol. The physical exam shows a depressed affect but no focal neurological issues. His TSH is 4.8, which is within the normal range (0.5-5). The options are about next steps in management.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that fluoxetine is an SSRI. SSRIs typically take around 4-6 weeks to show significant improvement. Since he's only been on it for three weeks, maybe it's too early to judge effectiveness. The question mentions his symptoms are \"roughly unchanged,\" so perhaps they just need more time. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA) Levothyroxine: His TSH is normal (4.8 is within the given range), so hypothyroidism isn't indicated here. So probably not A.\n\nB) Change to bupropion: Bupropion is another antidepressant, but it's a NDRI, not an SSRI. But since he's only been on fluoxetine for 3 weeks, maybe switching too early isn't the best step. \n\nC) Change to escitalopram: That's another SSRI. Maybe considering a different SSRI, but again, maybe the current one needs more time. \n\nD) Increase dose: Fluoxetine's usual starting dose is 20 mg, maybe increasing to 40 mg? But again, maybe it's better to wait longer before increasing. \n\nE) Maintain dose: Since it's only 3 weeks, and the TSH is normal, perhaps the right answer is to continue the current dose and reassess in a few more weeks. \n\nThe key point here is the duration of treatment. SSRIs take time to work. The TSH is normal, so thyroid isn't the issue. So the next step would be to continue the current medication and monitor. Therefore, the answer is E.\n</think>\n\nE",

It is more common in young patients who are active (e.g. marathon runners). The classic conventional radiographic finding in cecal volvulus is the coffee bean sign, in which closed loops of intestine distend with gas, making visible the medial and lateral walls of dilated bowel. Diagnosis of cecal volvulus can be confirmed with a CT scan. Management involves analgesia, intravenous fluids, and surgical detorsion.\n\nHasbahceci et al. review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of cecal volvulus. The authors find that abdominal radiography has a low sensitivity for cecal volvulus. The authors recommend surgical management of cecal volvulus with resection with right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a radiograph demonstrating the \"coffee bean\" sign which is suggestive of a cecal volvulus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ileus presents after surgery or manipulation of the intestines with decreased peristalsis of the intestine leading to a failure to pass gas or have bowel movements. Treatment involves treating any electrolyte abnormalities, encouraging ambulation, and avoiding medications that decrease peristalsis (such as opioids).\n\nAnswer C: Ogilvie syndrome occurs when the colon wall is not appropriately undergoing peristalsis leading to a dilated colon with abdominal distension. It is more common in the elderly and critically ill patients. Treatment involves the placement of a rectal tube to decompress the intestines and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Sigmoid volvulus is more common in elderly and critically ill patients and presents with constipation, an absence of bowel movements, and a distended, tympanitic abdomen. Although the coffee bean sign may also be seen in patients with sigmoid volvulus, patients tend to be older. In addition, plain radiography typically demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels in a sigmoid volvulus versus usually only a single air-fluid level in a cecal volvulus. Treatment involves flexible sigmoidoscopy and surgery.\n\nAnswer E: Small bowel obstruction presents with a distended and tympanitic abdomen with nausea, vomiting, and an absence of flatus or bowel movements. Radiography may demonstrate distended bowel and air-fluid levels, and the most accurate test is a CT scan of the abdomen. It occurs secondary to adhesions entrapping the bowel. Management involves the placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous fluids, and surgery.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCecal volvulus presents in younger patients with abdominal pain, distention, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and the \"coffee bean\" sign on radiography.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 24-year-old man with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that started during a marathon and continued after finishing. He's otherwise healthy. Vital signs are mostly normal except for a slightly elevated heart rate. The abdomen is distended and tender, and the radiograph is mentioned but we can't see it. The options are cecal volvulus, ileus, Ogilvie syndrome, sigmoid volvulus, or small bowel obstruction.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these conditions presents like. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nStarting with Ogilvie syndrome, which is also called acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. It's a condition where the colon dilates without a mechanical obstruction. It's often seen in elderly patients, especially post-surgery or with some medical illness. But the patient here is 24 and healthy, so maybe less likely. However, the key here is that Ogilvie can cause massive colonic dilation, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain and distension. But the question mentions the patient is a marathon runner, so maybe some physical strain?\n\nCecal volvulus is a twisting of the cecum, which is part of the large intestine. It's more common in young adults, especially in regions where it's prevalent, like India. The symptoms would be sudden abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting. The cecum can twist, leading to obstruction. The radiograph might show a dilated cecum.\n\nSigmoid volvulus is another type of intestinal obstruction where the sigmoid colon twists on itself. It's more common in elderly or in regions with low-fiber diets. It can cause similar symptoms but might present with a \"coffee bean\" sign on X-ray. The sigmoid is lower in the abdomen, so maybe the location of pain could differ, but the question doesn't specify.\n\nIleus is a general lack of peristalsis, often post-surgery or due to electrolyte imbalances. The patient here was running a marathon, so maybe dehydration? But the vitals don't show severe dehydration (BP is okay, temp normal). Ileus would present with generalized distension and absence of bowel sounds. The X-ray might show multiple air-fluid levels throughout the abdomen.\n\nSmall bowel obstruction (SBO) is a mechanical blockage, often from adhesions, hernias, etc. The patient is young and healthy, so maybe less likely unless there",

Management in an unstable patient is centered on cardioversion. Otherwise, the first step in management is centered on vagal maneuvers. If these fail, adenosine is the first-line pharmacologic treatment. While a relatively safe drug, side effects of adenosine include hypotension, heart block, flushing, and bronchospasm. Patients may also report a \"sense of impending doom\" following administration, thought to be the result of the transient asystole adenosine produces. Persistent SVT refractory to adenosine may be further managed with calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or cardioversion.\n\nColucci et al. review the diagnosis and management of common types of supraventricular tachycardias. The most common types of supraventricular tachycardia are caused by a reentry phenomenon producing accelerated heart rates. Symptoms may include palpitations, chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, and dyspnea. If Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is present, expedient referral to a cardiologist is warranted because ablation is a potentially curative option.\n\nFigure A is an ECG demonstrating SVT. Note the regular narrow complex tachycardia that is a defining feature of this condition.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: A disulfiram-like reaction was once thought to be associated with medications such as metronidazole. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that covers anaerobes. When alcohol is consumed in a patient on disulfiram, headache, malaise, nausea, and vomiting may be experienced.\n\nAnswer C: Photosensitivity is associated with medications such as sulfonamides, amiodarone, and tetracycline. Patients should be advised to stay out of the sun on these medications.\n\nAnswer D: Seizures are not associated with adenosine. Isoniazid, bupropion, imipenem/cilastatin, tramadol, enflurane, and metoclopramide are all known to increase the risk of seizures. Seizures often present with tonic-clonic activity, tongue biting, urinary incontinence, and a postictal phase.\n\nAnswer E: Tachycardia can be associated with medications such as atropine which reduce vagal tone on the heart increasing the heart rate. Medications that block the AV node would be expected to cause bradycardia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAdenosine is a first-line pharmacological agent in supraventricular tachycardia and can cause hypotension, heart block, flushing, and bronchospasm.",

The key points here are the rapid heart rate and the fact that after vagal maneuvers didn't work, an IV medication was given. The effect wore off quickly, and we need to know a potential side effect of that medication.\n\nFirst, the high heart rate suggests a tachycardia. Since the ECG isn't visible, but given the context, maybe it's SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) since vagal maneuvers are commonly tried first for that. If vagal maneuvers didn't work, the next step is often adenosine. Adenosine is a rapid-acting medication given IV for SVT. It works quickly but has a short half-life, so the effect wearing off in seconds makes sense here.\n\nNow, the side effects of adenosine. Common ones include flushing, which is option B. Disulfiram-like reaction (A) is more with metronidazole or certain other drugs, which cause reactions with alcohol. Photosensitivity (C) could be from tetracyclines or other meds. Seizures (D) might be a side effect of some medications but not typically adenosine, though adenosine can sometimes cause a brief asystole. Tachycardia (E) is the problem here, but adenosine usually slows the heart rate, so tachycardia as a side effect doesn't fit. Wait, but maybe after the effect wears off, the heart rate comes back, but the question is about the side effect of the medication itself. The immediate side effects of adenosine include flushing, chest pain, shortness of breath, etc. So the answer should be B, Flushing.\n</think>\n\nB",

Patients can present with actinic keratosis, which is a pre-malignant lesion in sun-exposed areas. These lesions can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if risk factors such as sun exposure continue. The presentation of SCC is typically an ulcerative lesion in a sun-exposed area. A biopsy will demonstrate atypical keratinocytes and malignant cells, invasion into the dermis, and keratin \u201cpearls\u201d on histology. Treatment is with wide local surgical excision with histologic confirmation of negative margins.\n\nWaldman and Schmults present a review of the evidence regarding the epidemiology and treatment of squamous cell skin cancer. They discuss how the incidence of this disease continues to increase due to an aging population. They recommend local excision and treatment due to the risk of metastasis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating a rough scaly patch on the skin (red circle). This finding is consistent with actinic keratosis, which is a pre-malignant lesion typically found on sun-exposed areas.\n\nFigure/Illustration B demonstrates an ulcerative lesion with wound formation on the skin (red circle). This finding is consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, a malignant lesion that can progress from actinic keratosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Actinic keratosis represents a pre-malignant condition that this patient initially presented with (as demonstrated in Figure A). His current presentation reflects SCC, a progression from actinic keratosis given the new ulceration and non-healing wound.\n\nAnswer B: Basal cell carcinoma presents with a shiny or pearly appearance, rather than the ulcerative appearance that is seen in SCC. This disease should be treated with surgical excision.\n\nAnswer C: Melanoma presents with a pigmented lesion that has an irregular border, an uneven shape, and areas that differ in pigmentation. Patients with melanoma should undergo surgical staging as this disease can become metastatic and should be treated with surgical excision.\n\nAnswer D: Poor wound healing secondary to diabetes would be possible if there was a history of trauma to the scalp. The history of actinic keratosis and the current ulcerative lesion, point more toward a diagnosis of SCC. Non-healing wound in patients with diabetes are usually located on the foot rather than on the scalp.\n\nBullet Summary:\nActinic keratosis is a pre-malignant lesion that occurs in sun-exposed areas that can progress to squamous cell carcinoma.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of poorly managed type 2 diabetes, which is important because high blood sugar can affect wound healing. He's a farmer and gardener, so he might have had sun exposure. The initial exam showed something on his scalp (Figure A), and three months later, there's a non-healing cut (Figure B). His average glucose is 175 mg/dL, which is elevated but not extremely high.\n\nThe options are various skin conditions and diabetes-related wound healing. The key points here are the non-healing wound on the scalp and his diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes is known to impair wound healing because of factors like reduced blood flow, nerve damage, and immune system issues. The question is asking for the most likely diagnosis now, given the progression from Figure A to B, which is a worsening lesion that isn't healing.\n\nActinic keratosis is a precancerous growth from sun damage, usually scaly, but it might not present as a non-healing ulcer. Basal cell carcinoma typically grows slowly and might ulcerate, but it's more common in sun-exposed areas. However, it's usually not as affected by diabetes in terms of healing. Melanoma is more concerning for malignancy but might present differently, like a changing mole. Squamous cell carcinoma can become invasive and might be more likely in someone with chronic skin damage and sun exposure. However, the fact that the wound isn't healing could point to the diabetes complication rather than the primary skin cancer. \n\nWait, the question mentions that the patient was sent home with a glucose journal, and three months later the wound isn't healing. The key here is that the non-healing is likely due to his diabetes. The initial lesion might have been something like an actinic keratosis or a skin cancer, but the fact that it's not healing now is probably because of his poor glycemic control. The options include D: Poor wound healing secondary to diabetes. Since his glucose is still high (175), that's a strong indicator. The other options are types of skin cancers, but the question is about the most likely diagnosis now, which is the non-healing wound. So the answer is D. But wait, maybe the lesion itself is a skin cancer that's not healing because of diabetes? The question says \"the finding in Figure B is noted,\" but since we can't see the figures,",

In the absence of significant risk factors, colonoscopies can be used for screening starting at age 45 and repeated every 10 years if results are normal. If there is family history of colon cancer (one or more first degree relatives, including parent, sibling, or child), colonoscopies should be recommended starting at age 40 or 10 years prior to the age of the family member's diagnosis, whichever is earlier.

The USPSTF recommends starting Pap smears at age 21, and then every 3 years until 29. If co-testing with HPV is done, that's every 5 years starting at 30. Since she's 25, her prior Pap was normal a year ago, so next Pap should be in 3 years, but the options here are D (Pap in 5 years) or E (Pap with HPV now). Since she's under 30, co-testing isn't recommended yet. So option E might not be right because HPV co-testing isn't standard until 30. So D would be every 3 years, but the option says 5, which is longer. Wait, maybe the question is considering that her last Pap was a year ago, so next would be in 2 years? Hmm, but the options don't have that. The options given are D (5 years) or E. Maybe the standard is every 3 years, so in 2 years, but since the options don't have that, perhaps D is incorrect.

But the question is which should be started. The options are only one correct answer. Let me think again. The patient's history of IV drug use might put him at risk for other infections, but the cold sores point to HSV.

        "reason": "This patient is an elderly man with progressive confusion over weeks, a nonfocal neurologic exam, and a CT of the head showing a hypodense crescent, most consistent with chronic subdural hematoma (SDH). Cerebral atrophy plays the earliest role in this presentation, resulting in exposure of the bridging veins and subsequent rupture with even minor trauma.\n\nChronic subdural hematomas present gradually, most often with headaches, somnolence, light-headedness, cognitive impairment, and rarely, seizures. Typically, the neurologic exam is largely normal but rarely focal deficits such as contralateral hemiparesis from compression of the cortex underlying the hematoma or ipsilateral hemiparesis from the lateral displacement of the opposite cortex may occur. Chronic SDH most often occurs in the setting of cerebral atrophy related to increased age, chronic alcohol use, and prior traumatic brain injury. Exposure of the bridging veins allows even minor trauma to precipitate subdural bleeding. A non-contrast CT of the head is indicated in any elderly patient with decreased mentation and concern for chronic SDH. Since old blood appears hypodense, imaging will allow for the determination of whether the bleed is acute or chronic. Supportive care is usually sufficient for treatment but surgical evacuation of the hematoma can be considered in patients with focal deficits or an expanding hematoma.\n\nMehta et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of chronic subdural hematomas in elderly patients. They discuss how crescentic layering of fluid in the subdural space on a non-contrast computed tomography scan is diagnostic of this condition. They recommend close follow-up as many patients will develop a recurrence of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows a non-contrast CT scan of the head with a hypodense crescent left side (red circle). This finding is consistent with a chronic subdural hematoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aneurysmal rupture is an extremely uncommon cause of SDH and typically causes subarachnoid hemorrhage instead. It often presents with \u201cthe worst headache of my life\u201d or \u201cthunderclap headache,\u201d and would show hyperdensity in the subarachnoid space on head CT. Surgical clipping or endovascular treatment can prevent rebleeding.\n\nAnswer C: Elder abuse can be subtle and should always be considered when an elderly patient presents with confusion, bruising, or dishevelment. In children, abuse is an important cause of SDH, which may occur in the setting of \u201cshaken baby syndrome.\u201d However, abuse is not especially associated with chronic SDH in the elderly population, and there is another plausible reason for this patient\u2019s presentation (trauma from a fall as evidenced by the resolving ecchymosis on his knee).\n\nAnswer D: Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, which typically presents with focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis, aphasia, or sensory loss. Although this patient does have a history of hypertension, he is normotensive in the emergency room and has non-focal neurologic decline that has been slowly progressive, which is less consistent with stroke. Furthermore, in contrast to this patient\u2019s CT scan, acute ischemic stroke would likely present with a normal head CT and prior infarct would cause a hypodensity in the parenchyma itself. Treatment is with risk factor optimization when a patient presents outside the window for thrombolytic agents.\n\nAnswer E: Increased CSF due to poor reabsorption by arachnoid granules is the cause of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Patients typically present with the \u201cwet, wacky, and wobbly\u201d triad \u2013 urinary incontinence, mental status changes, and magnetic gait. Head CT would show dilated ventricles and management includes CSF shunting.\n\nBullet Summary:\nChronic subdural hematomas may occur in elderly patients due to cerebral atrophy and subsequent exposure of bridging veins that may tear with minor trauma.",

The physical exam shows lethargy, disorientation, and an ecchymosis on his left knee. The CT head is mentioned but we don't see the image. The question is asking which factor plays the earliest role in his presentation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider possible causes of acute confusion in the elderly. The differential includes infections (like UTI, pneumonia), metabolic issues (electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia), medications (especially antihypertensives leading to dehydration or hypotension), stroke, or maybe a subdural hematoma. The ecchymosis on the knee might suggest a recent fall, which could lead to a subdural hematoma. But the timeline is two weeks, so maybe a chronic subdural? Also, the medications: hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic which can cause dehydration, but also might contribute to low blood volume. Timolol is a beta-blocker used in glaucoma, which can affect blood pressure. The patient's BP here is 122/74, which is normal, but maybe he had fluctuations.\n\nThe options given are aneurysmal rupture, cerebral atrophy, elderly abuse, hypertension, increased CSF. Let's go through each. \n\nAneurysmal rupture (A) would present more acutely with sudden headache, maybe altered mental status, but the timeline here is two weeks. Plus, the CT might show subarachnoid hemorrhage, but the question mentions a green-blue ecchymosis, which is more of a trauma sign. But aneurysm rupture isn't directly linked to the ecchymosis. \n\nCerebral atrophy (B) is a gradual process, leading to dementia over years, but the acute confusion here might be due to something else. However, atrophy could contribute to subdural hematomas because the brain shrinks, making bridging veins more susceptible to tearing with minor trauma.

The increased PTH results in renal phosphate wasting, increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and increased renal calcium reabsorption.

The patient is a 45-year-old African American woman with a cough, abdominal pain, trouble focusing, recent weight loss, and poorly controlled GERD. She's been taking antacids. The lab results are important here.\n\nLooking at the serum labs first. The calcium is 12.5 mg/dL, which is elevated. The normal range for calcium is usually around 8.5-10.2, so 12.5 is definitely high. Then, the phosphorus is low at 2.0 mg/dL (normal is around 2.5-4.5). The alkaline phosphatase is 150 U/L, which is slightly elevated but not super high. \n\nNow, the urine sodium is 5 mmol/24 hours. That's really low. Normally, 24-hour urine sodium is around 100-200 mmol. Low urine sodium along with high serum calcium makes me think of something like hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism. In primary hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid hormone (PTH) is high, which causes increased calcium resorption from bones, increased calcium reabsorption in the kidneys (so kidneys hold onto calcium, leading to low urine calcium but wait, here the urine sodium is low. Wait, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, the urine sodium here is 5, which is low. Wait, maybe I confused the parameters. Let me recall: in hyperparathyroidism, PTH increases calcium reabsorption in the kidneys, so urine calcium would be low? Or high? Hmm. Wait, PTH increases calcium reabsorption in the kidneys, so less calcium is excreted, so urine calcium might be low. But sometimes in hyperparathyroidism, you can have high urine calcium because bone resorption releases calcium into blood, but the kidneys reabsorb more. Wait, maybe the urine calcium would be variable. Alternatively, maybe the low urine sodium is a different clue. Wait, the urine sodium here is 5 mmol/24h, which is very low. That might indicate volume depletion, but the patient's BP is normal. Alternatively, maybe the kidneys are retaining sodium because of high PTH?

CJD is usually spontaneous. Rarely, CJD may be familial or acquired (from iatrogenic transmission or dietary exposure). Aggregates of PrPsc lead to spongiform vacuolation. Clinically, this manifests with rapidly progressive mental deterioration with prominent executive dysfunction (declining concentration, judgment, and memory) and startle myoclonus.

The most important initial step in management is pericardiocentesis.\n\nCardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, infections, or malignancy. It can occur if there is an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac with inadequate time for the pericardial sac to stretch and for the heart to adapt to the compression that causes diastolic dysfunction. Patients will present with hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distension, muffled heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop > 10 mmHg with inspiration). The diagnosis can be supported with ultrasonography (in the clinical setting a point of care ultrasound will often be performed first); however, the initial step in management is a pericardiocentesis which will stabilize the patient. Subsequent management requires the placement of a pericardial drain or window, as well as treatment of the underlying cause.\n\nPrabhakar et al. discuss pericardial decompression syndrome, an infrequent complication of pericardiocentesis. The authors find that pericardial decompression syndrome presents with paradoxical hemodynamic instability and/or pulmonary edema following pericardiocentesis, especially in patients with underlying myocardial dysfunction. The authors recommend careful monitoring of patients after pericardiocentesis for the development of this complication.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating electrical alternans.

A tension pneumothorax would also present with hypotension, tachycardia, and jugular venous distension; however, it would not present with muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans on ECG. On exam, there would be an absence of unilateral breath sounds and the presence of tracheal deviation.\n\nAnswer B: Packed red blood cells are appropriate management of a hypotensive and tachycardic trauma patient when it is suspected that their unstable vitals are secondary to hemorrhage. In this patient, there is conclusive evidence (jugular venous distension and electrical alternans) that this patient has cardiac tamponade.\n\nAnswer C: Pericardial window is the appropriate long-term treatment of recurrent pericardial effusions as it allows for a permanent conduit for the drainage of fluid.

The key points here are the mechanism of injury (high-speed collision, no seatbelt), the hypotension, tachycardia, JVD. The combination of hypotension with JVD in a trauma patient makes me think of tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, or maybe a cardiac issue like a myocardial contusion. \n\nJugular venous distension in a hypotensive trauma patient is a red flag. Tension pneumothorax can present with JVD, hypotension, tracheal deviation, etc. But the patient was intubated, so maybe that's addressed? Wait, but the question is about the next step. Alternatively, pericardial tamponade (Beck's triad: hypotension, JVD, muffled heart sounds) is another possibility. The ECG might show electrical alternans, which is a sign of tamponade.

Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia.

She's presenting with dizziness, lightheadedness, and near-syncope but no actual loss of consciousness. She denies dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea. Her current meds include clopidogrel and aspirin, along with methotrexate and atorvastatin. The physical exam shows an irregular heartbeat, normal cardiac sounds, mild edema, and her ECG from discharge after MI was normal. Now, the question is about which part of the cardiac conduction system is affected.\n\nFirst, the key symptoms here are dizziness and near-syncope. These can be due to various causes, but given her history of MI and stents, we need to think about possible cardiac arrhythmias. The ECG upon discharge was normal, but now she has an irregular heartbeat. The options are parts of the conduction system: AV node, bundle branches, Bundle of His, Purkinje fibers, or SA node.\n\nThe SA node is the pacemaker. If it's affected, she might have sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest. But her pulse is 92, which is tachycardic, so maybe not SA node. The AV node is next. If there's a block here, like a second or third-degree AV block, that would prevent impulses from getting to the ventricles, leading to bradycardia and possible syncope. But her pulse is 92, which is faster. Wait, but maybe she has an irregular rhythm like atrial fibrillation (AFib), which can cause irregular R-R intervals. AFib is common post-MI, especially with left ventricular dysfunction. But the question is about the conduction system component affected.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a block in the Bundle of His or the bundle branches, that could lead to different issues. Bundle branch blocks (right or left) affect the bundle branches. A complete heart block (third-degree AV block) would involve the Bundle of His. But again, the pulse here is 92, which might not fit a complete block unless there's an escape rhythm. \n\nWait, the patient's ECG is shown in Figure A, which we can't see, but the question is from a test, so maybe the key is in",

The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber. Treatment is with diuresis and treatment of the underlying heart failure.\n\nAnswer D: A holosystolic murmur heard at the apex describes mitral valve regurgitation. This would be possible if a papillary muscle had ruptured in an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment is with mitral valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer E: A normal S1 and S2 is possible but is less likely given this patient's long-standing history of poorly managed hypertension.

However, as patients age, their risk for malignancy increases significantly. Therefore, stable patients older than 50 years of age with rectal bleeding, regardless of their symptoms or family history, should receive a colonoscopy to rule out malignancy. Patients younger than 50 with warning signs of colon cancer (abnormal bowel habits, weight loss, family history of colon cancer, iron deficiency anemia) should also be evaluated with a colonoscopy.

He doesn't have pain, but mentions occasional straining. No other symptoms like fatigue, fever, weight loss, or abdominal pain, which might reduce the likelihood of something more serious like colorectal cancer.

But the exam didn't show hemorrhoids, fissures, or skin tags. However, sometimes they can be internal and not visible on a quick exam. The patient strains, which is a risk factor for hemorrhoids. But since the colonoscopy was normal 3 years ago, maybe a sigmoidoscopy would be sufficient since the blood is lower down. But wait, the patient is 66, so colonoscopy is often recommended for anyone over 50 with new bleeding, even if previous was normal, because colon cancer can develop in that time.

Alternatively, since the blood is bright red and the exam didn't show issues, maybe sigmoidoscopy is enough. But the guidelines might say that for someone with new bleeding and a recent colonoscopy, maybe a repeat colonoscopy is needed. Wait, but the prior colonoscopy was 3 years ago.

        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 6-week-old girl with blood-streaked diapers. She's breastfed every 2-3 hours and has frequent voids. Her stools were previously soft, varying from mustard yellow to dark green, but now they're looser with blood. She's also been regurgitating some feedings. The key points here are the blood in the stools, regurgitation, and the fact that she's otherwise doing well\u2014weight on the 50th percentile, no signs of distress, normal vital signs except maybe the heart rate being a bit high but that's normal for an infant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider possible causes of blood-streaked stools in an infant. The options given are enzyme deficiency, hypertrophy of sphincter muscle, non-IgE-mediated reaction, gastric contents in esophagus (which might relate to reflux?), and telescoping intestine (intussusception). \n\nThe regurgitation makes me think of gastroesophageal reflux, but the question mentions passage of gastric contents into the esophagus, which is part of reflux. However, the blood in the stool could be from something else. Let's go through each option.\n\nOption A: Congenital enzyme deficiency. That might lead to issues digesting milk, like lactose intolerance. But lactose intolerance in a breastfed infant is less common, and symptoms might include diarrhea but not necessarily blood. Unless it's something like galactosemia, but that usually presents with more severe symptoms like vomiting, failure to thrive, and maybe liver issues. The baby here is thriving, so maybe not.\n\nOption B: Hypertrophy of the sphincter muscle. I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe anal sphincter hypertrophy? That could cause difficulty passing stool, leading to straining and possible fissures. But the stools are now looser, not hard. So maybe not.\n\nOption C: Non-IgE-mediated immunologic reaction. That sounds like something like food protein-induced enterocolitis, which can cause bloody stools, vomiting, and might be related to breast milk if the mother is consuming allergens. Since she's breastfed, maybe the baby is reacting to a protein in the mother's diet. The non-IgE part would mean it's a cell-mediated reaction, which can present with bloody diarrhea and vomiting. This seems possible.\n\nOption D: Passage of gastric contents into the esophagus. That's basically reflux",

It can be caused by antigens, medications, and trauma or may occur spontaneously. It often presents with notable edema of the lips and tongue and may threaten the airway. There are 3 subtypes. Hereditary and acquired angioedema occur secondary to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. As a result, the most effective therapy is to administer fresh frozen plasma which has C1-esterase inhibitor. On the other hand, drug-induced angioedema (often from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) does not respond well to C1-esterase inhibitor replacement and supportive therapy; discontinuing the offending agent is the mainstay of therapy.

No rash, so maybe not urticaria, but angioedema is more likely here.

This becomes problematic when they attend school or have a job that requires them to wake up early. The most appropriate initial therapy for delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene practices, and bright light therapy. Bright light therapy involves consistent timed exposure to a light box to simulate natural outdoor light, with the hope of resetting the circadian rhythm and moving the sleep phase earlier.

Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy.

But absence seizures typically present with sudden, brief episodes of staring, sometimes with automatisms, and the person doesn't remember them. However, the sudden falling asleep might not fit here. But the staring spells could be a clue towards seizures. However, the question is about the initial management step. Usually, you'd want to confirm the diagnosis before starting medication. But ethosuximide is specific for absence seizures.\n\nOption C: Modafinil. That's a wakefulness promoting agent, used for narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, or excessive sleepiness. If the patient has narcolepsy, modafinil could help. But again, you need to confirm the diagnosis first.

This neurodegenerative process leads to movement abnormalities such as bradykinesia, \u201ccogwheel\u201d muscle rigidity (intermittently increased muscle tone with passive range of motion), shuffling gait, postural instability, and a resting tremor sometimes referred to as \u201cpill-rolling\u201d in quality. Parkinson disease usually presents with unilateral symptoms and subsequently progresses to bilateral involvement. First-line treatment involves dopaminergic drugs such as carbidopa-levodopa. Antimuscarinic agents can also be used for symptom control.\n\nZhong et al. review the role of the cerebellum in tremor in Parkinson disease. The authors find that the cerebellum may modulate tremor amplitude via cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits. The authors recommend further study of the cerebellum as an alternative therapeutic target in Parkinson patients with dopamine-resistant tremors.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cerebellar stroke can manifest as an intention tremor, which presents as an oscillatory tremor that increases in amplitude at the endpoint of visually goal-directed movement. Intention tremors are best exhibited in the finger-nose-finger test in which the patient repeatedly touches their nose and then extends their arm to touch the examiner's finger. Patients would also have more severe symptoms including ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus.\n\nAnswer B: Essential tremor is a condition that is often familial and presents as a high frequency (4-9 Hz) tremor that occurs with sustained posture and is worsened with movement. Treatment includes propranolol and primidone.\n\nAnswer C: Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat disorder that leads to neurodegeneration of the caudate and putamen. Chorea is a hallmark movement abnormality associated with Huntington disease and presents with spontaneous, jerking, purposeless involuntary movements.\n\nAnswer D: Lacunar stroke can result in ischemia to the subthalamic nucleus and produce hemiballismus. This presents as spontaneous unilateral explosive movements of an upper extremity and occasionally the ipsilateral lower extremity. Other motor deficits are also expected when there is a lacunar infarct.\n\nBullet Summary:\nResting tremor is a hallmark of Parkinson disease and presents with low amplitude, 4-6 Hz oscillatory rhythmic movements that temporarily extinguish with voluntary movement.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 68-year-old man with a tremor that's been going on for three months. The key points here are the characteristics of the tremor. The question says the tremor improves when he reaches for objects but comes back when he's not using his hand. Wait, so when he moves voluntarily, the tremor stops. That's important.\n\nThe physical exam shows a 4-6 Hz tremor in the left hand when it's resting on his lap. And it goes away with voluntary movement. Also, there's increased tone in the left upper extremity during passive movement. Hmm, increased tone could be rigidity. \n\nNow, let's think about the options. Essential tremor (B) is usually an action tremor, meaning it happens when moving, like reaching for something, not at rest. So if the tremor is worse when moving, that's more essential tremor. But here, the tremor is present at rest and stops when moving. That's the opposite, so maybe not B.\n\nParkinson's disease (E) is classic with a resting tremor, the 4-6 Hz is the typical \"pill-rolling\" tremor. Also, Parkinson's has other features like rigidity (increased tone) and bradykinesia. The increased tone here matches that. So that's a strong candidate.\n\nCerebellar stroke (A) would cause intention tremor, which gets worse as the hand approaches a target. Also, cerebellar issues might have ataxia, but the tremor here is at rest, so probably not A.\n\nHuntington's disease (C) has choreiform movements, which are involuntary dance-like movements, not a resting tremor. Plus, Huntington's usually has cognitive changes, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLacunar stroke (D) typically affects small vessels, leading to symptoms like pure motor stroke. Maybe causing weakness or sensory issues, but a resting tremor isn't typical. Lacunar strokes are more about things like hemiparesis, not tremors.\n\nSo putting it together: Resting tremor (improves with movement), increased tone (rigidity), 4-6 Hz. That's classic Parkinson's disease. The answer should be E.\n</think>\n\nE",

        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The newborn has central cyanosis that doesn't improve with oxygen. The mother had diabetes managed with insulin and exercise, which makes me think of possible congenital anomalies because maternal diabetes is a risk factor for birth defects, especially heart issues. The baby's oxygen saturation is 80% on room air, which is really low. \n\nLooking at the options, all are congenital heart defects. Let's go through each. \n\nTetralogy of Fallot (A) typically presents with cyanosis, but often they have decreased pulmonary blood flow. The oxygen might not respond well, but sometimes they can have spells. The chest X-ray might show a \"boot-shaped\" heart. \n\nTotal anomalous pulmonary venous return (B) means the pulmonary veins don't connect to the left atrium. This can lead to mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. In the newborn, if it's obstructed, there might be severe cyanosis. The chest X-ray might show increased pulmonary vascularity or a \"snowman\" sign. \n\nTransposition of the great arteries (C) is when the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched. This leads to two separate circulations, so without a shunt, the baby would be profoundly cyanotic. The oxygen saturation would be low, and they often need immediate intervention. The ECG might show right ventricular hypertrophy. \n\nTricuspid atresia (D) is when the tricuspid valve is absent, so blood can't flow from the right atrium to the ventricle. This usually presents with cyanosis and might have a single ventricle. The CXR might show a normal or small heart with decreased lung markings. \n\nTruncus arteriosus (E) is a single great vessel arising from both ventricles. This leads to mixing and high pulmonary blood flow, so the CXR might show increased pulmonary markings. The baby would have cyanosis and heart failure signs. \n\nThe mother's diabetes increases the risk for heart defects.

In developed countries, these typically occur secondary to adhesions.\n\nSmall bowel obstructions (SBO) typically present with an absence of bowel sounds, bowel movements, and flatus, as well as abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting. They typically occur secondary to adhesions which entrap the bowel and disrupt its normal peristalsis. Adhesions can occur after abdominal surgery or trauma as part of the normal healing process. The diagnosis of SBO can be confirmed using abdominal imaging such as a CT scan. Treatment often involves observation; however, surgical decompression of the SBO may be needed if there is a closed-loop obstruction or an obstruction that does not resolve on its own.\n\nRami Reddy and Cappell review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SBO. They discuss how this disease has a 30% mortality rate if the diagnosis is missed and bowel perforation occurs. They recommend early evaluation and treatment of these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Enteric nervous system damage describes diabetic gastroparesis which can present similarly to SBO; however, this patient's age and history of surgery points toward SBO as the most likely diagnosis. Treatment is with pro-motility agents.\n\nAnswer C: Impacted stool describes constipation which could present similarly to SBO; however, this diagnosis is less likely to cause nausea and vomiting unless it is severe. The vomit typically smells like stool. Treatment is with dis-impaction of the colon.\n\nAnswer D: Norovirus typically causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea but does not cause distension and a tympanitic abdomen. Treatment is supportive as the virus self-resolves.\n\nAnswer E: Twisting of bowel describes a volvulus which presents similarly to SBO; however, it is a more common diagnosis in the elderly and is a less common diagnosis than is SBO in a patient with a history of abdominal surgery.

His symptoms get worse after fatty meals and alcohol. His wife came back from a cruise with vomiting and diarrhea. His medical history includes poorly managed diabetes, constipation, anxiety, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Vital signs show high blood pressure (197/128), elevated temperature, and some other signs. The physical exam mentions a systolic murmur, an obese and distended abdomen with a scar in the right lower quadrant, and weak pulses in the legs.\n\nFirst, the key symptoms here are nausea and vomiting, especially after fatty meals and alcohol. The fact that his wife had vomiting and diarrhea after a cruise makes me think of norovirus, which is common on cruises and spreads easily. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nLooking at the options: A is adhesions, which can cause bowel obstruction, but the timing and the wife's symptoms might point elsewhere. B is enteric nervous system damage, which could be from diabetes (since he has poorly managed diabetes, which can lead to autonomic neuropathy). That might cause gastroparesis, which presents with nausea, vomiting after eating, especially fatty foods. But the wife's illness might suggest an infectious cause. C is impacted stool, which can cause obstruction, but the abdominal exam mentions a distended abdomen and a prior scar (maybe from appendectomy?), but constipation is part of his history. D is norovirus, which fits with the cruise exposure and the wife's symptoms. E is bowel twisting (volvulus), which is a surgical emergency, but the presentation might be more acute with severe pain.\n\nWait, the patient's symptoms have been going on for a week. Norovirus typically has an acute onset with self-limiting illness (1-3 days). So maybe D is less likely if the symptoms have lasted a week. The wife's recent illness might be norovirus, but the patient's symptoms are longer. Alternatively, maybe the patient's symptoms are due to something else, and the wife's case is a red herring?\n\nThe patient has diabetes, which can lead to autonomic neuropathy affecting the enteric nervous system (option B).

The most likely diagnosis is a urethral diverticulum.\n\nA urethral diverticulum is an abnormal, localized outpouching of the urethral mucosa often due to recurrent periurethral gland infection. The outpouching can often collect and store urine, resulting in slow postvoid dribbling and recurrent urinary tract infections. Urethral diverticula can often be associated with expressed purulent or bloody discharge on exam. Initial workup includes urinalysis and transvaginal ultrasound. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a pelvic MRI before referral for surgical excision.\n\nGreiman et al. review urethral diverticula and its treatment. They note that surgical repair is challenging. However, it is still recommended to perform surgery in appropriate candidates.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Overflow incontinence (caused by impaired detrusor activity or bladder outlet obstruction) can also present with involuntary loss of urine due to urinary retention. However, this patient\u2019s normal postvoid residual volume (< 150 mL) makes this an unlikely diagnosis. Patients will often present with a constant dribbling of urine and a sensation of incomplete voiding.\n\nAnswer B: Pelvic organ prolapse occurs due to weakened pelvic support and increased intraabdominal pressure and can be exacerbated by increasing parity. While it can also present with incontinence, physical exam often reveals a bulging mass that increases with Valsava maneuver - a finding that is absent in this patient.\n\nAnswer C: Stress urinary incontinence is caused by urethral hypermobility leading to urinary leakage from increased intraabdominal pressure. This patient\u2019s urinary loss is unrelated to coughing or laughing, and stress incontinence would not explain the anterior vaginal mass. On exam, urine may be released with coughing.\n\nAnswer E: Vesicovaginal fistula is an abnormal tract between the vagina and bladder that presents with constant leakage of urine due to the direct draining of urine from the bladder to the vagina. This patient\u2019s incontinence is intermittent and not constant, and a vesicovaginal fistula would not explain the anterior vaginal mass.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA urethral diverticulum presents with dysuria, intermittent urinary incontinence, and a tender anterior vaginal wall mass that may cause recurrent urinary tract infections.",

Overflow incontinence (A) is when the bladder doesn't empty properly, leading to constant dribbling. The post-void residual is 60 mL, which is a bit elevated but not extremely high. Overflow could be possible, but the presence of a mass might point elsewhere.\n\nPelvic organ prolapse (B) usually involves a bulging sensation, maybe a vaginal bulge that changes with Valsalva.

These can get infected, leading to recurrent UTIs, dysuria, and a tender mass. The anterior vaginal wall mass that's tender fits here. Also, women with urethral diverticula often have recurrent UTIs that don't resolve completely, which matches her history of two UTI treatments in six months.

The key points here are the progression of sinusitis symptoms despite initial treatment and the presence of purulent and bloody discharge.\n\nFirst, acute sinusitis is often viral, but if it's not improving or getting worse, a bacterial superinfection becomes more likely.

Once a patient has failed treatment with multiple medications (at least 2) from different classes, the next best step in management is clozapine. This medication is reserved for patients who have sustained treatment failure (because of the side effects of clozapine). These include weight gain, life-threatening agranulocytosis, and aplastic anemia. Regular complete blood count laboratory testing should be drawn while on clozapine to check for this side effect.

The choices are Chalazion, Foreign body, Hordeolum, Ingrown eyelash follicle, and Meibomian cell carcinoma. \n\nStarting with the basics: a chalazion is a painless bump that forms due to a blocked oil gland in the eyelid. It's usually firm and not tender. Hordeolum, or a stye, is an infection of the oil glands, so it's typically red, swollen, and painful. Since the nodule here isn't painful, that might lean away from hordeolum. \n\nForeign body would likely cause more irritation, redness, and possibly pain, so maybe not. Ingrown eyelash follicle (trichiasis) might cause discomfort or irritation but not a firm nodule. \n\nNow, considering his history of squamous cell carcinoma, which was treated with Mohs surgery. Squamous cell carcinoma can sometimes recur, especially in the same area. The eyelid is a common site for skin cancers. Meibomian cell carcinoma sounds like it could be a type of cancer, perhaps meibomian gland carcinoma. Wait, meibomian gland carcinoma is a type of sebaceous gland carcinoma, which can present as a painless nodule. Since the patient has a history of skin cancer, this might be a consideration. \n\nChalazion is benign, but given the history of cancer, even though it's squamous cell, maybe there's a possibility of a different type here. The nodule is firm and rubbery, which could be a tumor. The temperature is slightly elevated, but not too high. Blood pressure is elevated, but that might not be directly related. \n\nSo, between chalazion and meibomian carcinoma. Chalazion is more common and usually not cancerous.

        "reason": "This patient with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, acute onset of left-sided oculomotor nerve palsy (mydriasis, ptosis, and \u201cdown and out\u201d pupil), right-sided paresis, and right-sided dysdiadochokinesia most likely has a lacunar stroke of the left midbrain.\n\nImportant structures in the midbrain often affected by stroke include the oculomotor nucleus, substantia nigra, corticospinal tract, red nucleus, and superior cerebellar peduncle. Occlusions to branches of the basilar artery lead to infarctions of various parts of the midbrain. Midbrain lesions almost always manifest with an ipsilateral oculomotor palsy (ptosis from the levator palpebrae muscle; mydriasis from loss of parasympathetic inflow; abduction and excyclotorsion of the globe from the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior obliques). There may also be contralateral ataxia (cerebellar peduncle after decussation and red nucleus), contralateral hemiparesis (corticospinal tract before decussation at the medulla), and parkinsonian tremor (substantia nigra).\n\nSciacca et al. review the anatomy and clinical signs of strokes of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. They discuss how a stroke of the midbrain will present with oculomotor palsy and paresis. They recommend being vigilant for symptoms of strokes to allow for early diagnosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) is usually due to a stroke of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This presents with ipsilateral ataxia, loss of pain and temperature sensation in the face, dysarthria, and Horner syndrome, as well as contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the body. In this patient with intact sensorium and without dysarthria, lateral medullary syndrome is less likely.\n\nAnswer B: Lateral pontine syndrome can be caused by interruption of blood supply by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. It presents with ipsilateral limb and gait ataxia, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral facial hemianesthesia, ipsilateral facial paralysis, nystagmus and vertigo, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature in the body. In this patient with intact sensorium and without facial paralysis, vertigo, and oculomotor palsy, midbrain stroke is more likely than a pontine stroke.\n\nAnswer C: Medial pontine syndrome can be due to occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar artery and disrupts the abducens nerve, the dorsal column-medial lemniscus, and the corticospinal tract. This results in contralateral spastic hemiparesis, ipsilateral lateral rectus paralysis (eye turned down and in), and contralateral loss of vibration and stereognosis. In this patient with ptosis, and an eye turned down and out, oculomotor palsy and a midbrain stroke are more likely than a pontine stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. Strokes of the internal capsule would not be expected to lead to oculomotor nerve palsy or dysdiadochokinesia. The constellation of ataxia, hemiparesis, and cranial nerve palsy is more suggestive of a brainstem pathology than of a lacunar stroke in the internal capsule.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMidbrain strokes commonly present with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis/hemiplegia, contralateral hemiataxia, and/or contralateral tremor.",
        "completion": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 67-year-old man with sudden-onset weakness and double vision. His history includes hyperlipidemia and poorly controlled hypertension, which are risk factors for vascular issues like stroke. The medications he's on are atorvastatin (for cholesterol) and amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker for blood pressure), but his current BP is still high at 175/95, so that's a concern.\n\nLooking at the physical exam findings: the left pupil is 6mm compared to 3mm on the right. The left eye is displaced laterally and downward, and there's left-sided ptosis. These findings point to a problem with the oculomotor nerve (CN III) because ptosis and pupil dilation are classic signs of CN III palsy. However, the eye position being lateral and downward might be a bit confusing. Wait, CN III controls most of the eye muscles except for the lateral rectus (CN VI) and superior oblique (CN IV). If the left eye is displaced laterally and downward, maybe there's a combination here. Wait, maybe I need to think again. A complete CN III palsy would lead to a drooping eyelid (ptosis), dilated pupil (mydriasis), and the eye would be in a down and out position because the muscles that move the eye medially, up, and inward are paralyzed. So if the left eye is displaced laterally and downward, that might fit with a CN III palsy. But the pupil is involved here, so it's likely a third nerve palsy affecting the left side.\n\nNow, the motor exam shows right-sided weakness (2/5 in right upper and lower extremities) and right-sided dysdiadochokinesia. Dysdiadochokinesia is a sign of cerebellar dysfunction, so that points to involvement of the cerebellum or its pathways. But the question is about the region of the brain affected. Let's see the options again: lateral medulla, lateral pons, medial pons, midbrain, or posterior limb of internal capsule.\n\nThe midbrain is where the CN III nucleus is located. A midbrain lesion could cause a CN III palsy. Additionally, the motor weakness on the right side suggests a contralateral upper motor neuron lesion. Since the right side is weak, the lesion would be on the left side (since the cort",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after administration of naloxone with respiratory distress, wheezing, crackles, and pulmonary edema on chest radiography, suggesting acute pulmonary edema. Given the presence of symptoms immediately following naloxone administration, the cause of the pulmonary edema is likely the naloxone (medication-induced) that was administered.\n\nOpioid use disorder is a common problem in the United States and can lead to overdose, which is life-threatening if not treated. Patients with symptoms of opioid intoxication including miosis, bradypnea, and altered mental status should be empirically given naloxone, as it may be life-saving and is relatively benign. Naloxone should only be given for patients with unstable vitals or who are failing to ventilate/oxygenate or protect their airway. Naloxone commonly precipitates withdrawal and may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain. It is possible for naloxone to cause pulmonary edema (via a poorly elucidated mechanism). Pulmonary edema presents with wheezing, tachypnea, and pulmonary crackles. The most important intervention when treating pulmonary edema is to address the underlying cause and start the patient on positive pressure ventilation. Diuretics may be administered if the patient is volume overloaded. An echogardiogram can rule out poor cardiac function as the underlying etiology as well.\n\nLassen et al. review naloxone use and pulmonary edema. They note that naloxone administration can cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and that the mechanism is not well elucidated. They recommend that naloxone should only be used at the lowest dose possible to stabilize the patient.\n\nFigure A is a chest radiograph demonstrating \"fluffy\" interstitial infiltrates throughout both lung fields suggestive of pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atypical pneumonia may present with a dry cough, fever, hypoxia, and increased interstitial markings on chest radiograph. These patients are usually well appearing, and the opacities are not as \"fluffy\" as pulmonary edema. A common cause is Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n\nAnswer B: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with a flattened diaphragm and increased number of visible ribs on chest radiography as a result of air accumulation in the chest. Pneumonia may be present on chest radiograph and is a common cause of COPD flares. A COPD flare may present with wheezing, poor air movement, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.\n\nAnswer C: Community-acquired pneumonia presents with a fever, cough, hypoxia, and a lobar consolidation on chest radiograph. This infiltrate is usually confined to one lobe and is thus often called \"lobar pneumonia.\" Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause.\n\nAnswer E: Poor cardiac function can cause pulmonary edema via increased hydrostatic pressure backing up into the lungs causing fluid leakage. Though the appearance of pulmonary edema would be the same, naloxone causes non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In this patient with a previous myocardial infarction, a low ejection fraction may plausibly be contributing to this patient's pulmonary edema; however, the association of symptoms with naloxone administration makes this a less likely etiology for this case.\n\nBullet Summary:\nNaloxone can cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.",
        "completion": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of polysubstance abuse, including cocaine, which has led to cardiomyopathy and a previous MI. He was found obtunded, and naloxone reversed his symptoms, suggesting an opioid overdose. However, after waking up, he's having trouble breathing with crackles and wheezing.\n\nFirst, the immediate effect of naloxone reversing the obtundation and improving oxygenation points to an opioid overdose. But now, even after reversal, he's still short of breath with crackles and wheezing. The options given are atypical pneumonia, COPD, community-acquired pneumonia, medication (maybe the naloxone?), or poor cardiac function.\n\nHis history includes cocaine-induced cardiomyopathy. Cocaine can cause coronary vasospasm leading to MI, but also, in the acute setting, it can lead to acute coronary syndromes. However, he's currently alert, so the main issue now is the respiratory symptoms. The crackles suggest pulmonary edema, which could be due to cardiac issues like worsening heart failure. Since he has a history of cardiomyopathy, poor cardiac function (option E) leading to pulmonary edema is a possibility. \n\nAlternatively, the crackles and wheezing could be from an asthma exacerbation or COPD (option B). But he has a 40 pack-year smoking history, so COPD is possible. However, the timing after an opioid overdose and reversal might point to something else. \n\nAnother angle: when naloxone is given, it can reverse the respiratory depression from opioids, but sometimes it can unmask other issues. For example, if the patient had an MI from cocaine, maybe the cardiac issue was contributing, but the main problem was the overdose. Now that the overdose is reversed, the underlying cardiac issue (like heart failure) is presenting. The crackles and tachypnea (26/min) with low oxygen (88% on room air) could be pulmonary edema from poor cardiac function. \n\nAlternatively, could it be atypical pneumonia (A) or community-acquired (C)? Those would typically present with fever, which he doesn't have (temp 96\u00b0F is low). So maybe not pneumonia. \n\nMedication administration (D) \u2013 maybe the naloxone caused an issue? Unlikely. Naloxone's side effects don't include respiratory distress like that. \n\nSo between COP",
