Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",

        "reason": "The patient\u2019s sudden-onset knee pain with effusion and synovial fluid findings are characteristic of gout.\n\nGout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in joint spaces, most commonly in the big toe, ankle, or knee. Crystal deposition in the joint space leads to an intense inflammatory reaction that causes severe pain and joint effusion. Gout is most commonly due to lifestyle factors including a diet high in red meat and alcohol. Medications that cause elevated uric acid levels (such as thiazide diuretics) may also play a role. Conditions resulting in high cell turnover and therefore excessive purine release such as hematologic malignancies may also lead to the development of gout. Patients typically present with sudden-onset, severe pain, erythema, and joint effusion. Synovial fluid analysis will reveal an elevated leukocyte count and negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals. Treatment of acute gout is with NSAID medications, colchicine, or steroids depending on presentation and patient-specific factors. Prevention of further attacks is centered around lifestyle changes such as avoidance of red meat and alcohol. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol are also often used for prevention of further episodes.\n\nNeogi discusses the management of acute gout. She comments that, while synovial fluid analysis is the gold standard of diagnosis, many physicians do not routinely perform it, instead relying on clinical judgment to diagnose gout. The differential diagnosis for a gout-like presentation includes pseudogout, septic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, reactive arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nFigure A shows monosodium urate crystals, which appear as negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals under polarized light.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Lyme disease may also presents as a monoarticular arthritis in later stages. However, a recent history of tick exposure and preceding flu-like illness would also be expected.\n\nAnswer C: Pseudogout presents similar to gout, but is caused by calcium pyrophosphate deposition. Crystals appear rhomboid shaped and are positively birefringent under polarized light.\n\nAnswer D: Septic arthritis typically has higher leukocyte counts (> 50,000/mm^3) in the synovial fluid with organisms visualized on gram stain. Fever would also be expected.\n\nAnswer E: Rheumatoid arthritis may present as a monoarticular arthritis with acute flairs.

His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism. This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea. Treating the underlying cause in addition to rifaximin will eliminate the excess bacteria.\n\nBullet Summary:\nProton pump inhibitors should be given in patients with persistent diarrhea in the setting of chronic pancreatitis to prevent the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes.",

Riluzole, a glutamate inhibitor, is currently the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication that improves survival in patients with ALS.\n\nALS is a neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons. Upper motor neuron signs include spasticity and hyperreflexia, while lower motor neuron signs include muscle atrophy and fasciculations (spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation). In patients with bulbar-onset ALS, the initial clinical presentation is dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue atrophy, and abnormal jaw jerk reflex. Riluzole decreases the rate of glutamate release from presynaptic neurons, which is thought to decrease excitatory neurotoxicity. Riluzole improves survival by 2-6 months in patients with ALS and may have a greater survival benefit in patients with bulbar-onset ALS.\n\nMasori and Van Damme review the genetics, pathophysiology, classic clinical presentation, extra-motor manifestations, diagnostic workup, and treatment for ALS. They discuss how riluzole provides a survival benefit in patients with this disease. They recommend treating patients with ALS using riluzole as tolerated.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist that reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters to decrease spasticity in ALS. Along with tizanidine, baclofen is a first-line symptomatic treatment for spasticity in ALS. Baclofen does not improve survival in ALS.\n\nAnswer B: Dextromethorphan and quinidine is a combination of a sigma opioid receptor agonist and a sodium channel blocker used to control pseudobulbar affect in patients with ALS. Pseudobulbar affect is a sudden uncontrollable outburst of laughter or tearfulness that affects almost half of patients with ALS. Dextromethorphan and quinidine has not been shown to improve survival in ALS.\n\nAnswer C: Edaravone is an intravenous antioxidant that may decrease the progression of early ALS. Although it is now FDA approved, studies have not yet shown that edaravone improves survival in patients with ALS. Further studies will be needed in order to determine the risks and benefits of using this drug.\n\nAnswer E: Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist that decreases spasticity in ALS by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. Excess spasticity in ALS can negatively impact coordination, ambulation, and other activities of daily living. Tizanidine and other antispastic medications do not improve survival in patients with ALS.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRiluzole is a glutamate inhibitor that improves survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

Of the answer choices given, angiodysplasia is the most likely to cause such profuse and sudden bleeding.\n\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly in the colon. The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. The authors note that angiodysplasias are the cause of many \"occult\" GI bleeds not visualized on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. The authors recommend the use of capsule endoscopy in occult GI bleeds to identify angiodysplasias as a potential source.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Erosion into a gastric vessel is the pathophysiology of a bleeding gastric vessel secondary to peptic ulcer disease. This usually presents with melena (black tarry stools) rather than bright red blood per rectum. Only in cases of extremely brisk upper GI bleeding would patients present with bright red blood per rectum. Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Diverticulosis presents with bright red blood and is possible in this patient, but it does not involve inflammation or infection, which defines diverticulitis.\n\nAnswer C: Malignancy or colon cancer can present with bright red blood per rectum, malaise, weight loss, and microcytic anemia.

In an infant who is formula fed, the most appropriate next step would be switching to either an extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based infant formula.\n\nGiannetti et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of milk protein allergy in infants. They discuss how the selective elimination of certain proteins from the diet is usually effective. They recommend considering oral immunotherapy as an adjuvant in the treatment of this disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph that demonstrates the finding of eczema (red circle). This finding is commonly found in patients with milk-protein allergy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Initiating a proton pump inhibitor would be appropriate in patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease, which presents with regurgitation or vomiting and symptoms of feeding aversion or failure to thrive. Because this patient presents with bloody stools, he is more likely to have a milk protein allergy.\n\nAnswer B: Obtaining an abdominal ultrasound would help evaluate for pyloric stenosis, which presents in infants between 3-6 months of age with non-bilious, projectile vomiting. Pyloric stenosis does not cause bloody stools. Treatment is with surgical pyloromyotomy.\n\nAnswer C: Providing reassurance would not be appropriate for an infant presenting with bloody stools and evidence of poor weight gain. The cause of his blood-streaked stools should be investigated to ensure this patient is getting the nutrition he needs.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to a hydrolyzed formula would be appropriate if this patient were formula fed, but it is not necessary to discontinue breastfeeding if the mother is willing to modify her diet to exclude cow\u2019s milk and soy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA milk-protein allergy in a breastfed infant should be treated with modification of the mother\u2019s diet to eliminate cow\u2019s milk and soy.",

A serum TSH and free T4 would be most informative in confirming this diagnosis.\n\nMyxedema coma (decompensated hypothyroidism) is the most life-threatening manifestation of hypothyroidism. Key clinical features include hypothermia (often the temperature is <95.9\u00b0F (35.5\u00b0C)), bradycardia, hypotension, bradypnea (causing a respiratory acidosis), hypoxia, and obtundation. Immediate management is centered on warming the patient, warmed IV fluids, and protecting the patient's airway, if needed. If there is high clinical suspicion for myxedema coma, then IV levothyroxine can be given empirically. Otherwise, the TSH and free T4 should be checked, which will reveal an elevated TSH and a low free T4. Patients are often critically ill and require active rewarming and close monitoring in an ICU setting.\n\nWall reviews myxedema coma. Wall notes that myxedema coma is a life-threatening manifestation of hypothyroidism. She recommends that generally IV T4 (levothyroxine) is preferred over IV T3 in initial management.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering glucagon would be appropriate in a beta-blocker overdose, which presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. There is no indication that this patient intentionally overdosed, and her hyponatremia and thinning hair supports a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Other treatments that can be given in a beta-blocker overdose including epinephrine, calcium, insulin, dextrose, and lipid emulsion therapy.\n\nAnswer C: Obtaining blood cultures and a serum lactate is the appropriate management of sepsis/septic shock. Generally, patients with septic shock present with hypotension (refractory to fluid resuscitation), tachycardia, and fever or hypothermia. Though myocardial depression may happen in critically ill patients who are about to undergo cardiac arrest, hypothyroidism better explains this patient's constellation of symptoms. It would be appropriate to obtain cultures and a serum lactate in this patient while the differential is being narrowed.\n\nAnswer D: Performing a CT scan of the head would be indicated at some point in the workup of patients with altered mental status if there was a suspected central nervous system etiology such as a subdural hematoma. However, hemodynamically unstable patients should never be sent to the CT scanner prior to stabilization and resuscitation. A subdural hematoma is more common in older patients and patients with alcohol use disorder who experience head trauma as the atrophy of their brain makes the bridging veins more vulnerable.\n\nAnswer E: Performing an echocardiogram may show reduced cardiac function; however, it is unlikely to reveal the underlying cause of this patient's hypotension and bradycardia other than showing poor cardiac function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMyxedema coma presents as a critically ill, obtunded patient who is hypothermic, bradycardic, and hypotensive, and the diagnosis can be supported with a high TSH and a low free T4.",

This suggests a diagnosis of central retinal artery occlusion and management should focus on control of underlying risk factors given that he is 2 days out from the event.\n\nSymptoms of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) include sudden, painless, complete, and normally unilateral vision loss. A fundoscopic exam can show pallor of the optic disc, diffuse ischemic whitening of the retina, cherry-red macula, retinal edema, and constricted/bloodless retinal arterioles. The center of the macula appears red because the photoreceptor layer at the fovea is perfused by the posterior choroidal vasculature rather than the central retinal artery. Treatment involves surgical decompression of the retinal anterior chamber, ideally within 1 hour of the occlusion. Tissue plasminogen activator should be administered if the patient presents within an acceptable time frame. If surgical intervention is not readily available, additional steps with minimal evidence to support their use include ocular massage (to dislodge the embolus) and either carbogen therapy or hyperbaric oxygen. Chronic management includes control of underlying risk factors with aspirin and statin therapy.\n\nDattilo et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of central retinal artery occlusion. They discuss how treatments have not been particularly effective in the treatment of this disorder. They recommend engaging in secondary prevention of vascular events by controlling risk factors.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a fundoscopic photograph showing retinal pallor surrounding the superior temporal arcade (red circle). This finding is characteristically seen in central retinal artery occlusion.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering ranibizumab is not appropriate because this medication is an anti-VEGF antibody, which can be used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration. Symptoms of wet age-related macular degeneration include acute visual distortion and loss of central vision that occurs over months. A fundoscopic exam would show neovascularization.\n\nAnswer B: Administration of tissue plasma activator has not been shown to be beneficial in central retinal artery occlusion if the event has occurred several days ago. This medication is used in patients who sustain an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of developing symptoms. A stroke in the posterior lobe can present with cortical hemianopsia.\n\nAnswer D: Retinal photocoagulation is used to treat diabetic retinopathy. In diabetic retinopathy, symptoms of painless vision loss present gradually. A retinal exam would show retinal hemorrhage and possibly neovascularization.\n\nAnswer E: Timolol is a beta-blocker used to treat glaucoma. Assessment of the optic disk would show an enlarged cup-to-disk ratio. Glaucoma can present with pain and pressure in the affected eye. Acute angle closure glaucoma would present with a rock-hard eye and may lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nChronic management of central retinal artery occlusion involves control of underlying risk factors with aspirin and statin therapy.",

Most umbilical hernias in children resolve spontaneously and can be managed expectantly.\n\nAn umbilical hernia is a protrusion of bowel, omentum, or preperitoneal fat through the umbilical ring that can change in size with increases in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., crying). The majority of umbilical hernias in patients under 5 years of age resolve spontaneously. The indications for surgery on umbilical hernias in that age group are limited to incarcerated hernias or hernias > 1.5 cm in diameter. Incarcerated hernias present with an irreducible mass that is associated with pain and erythema. Surgical closure may be considered in patients whose defects fail to close by the age of 5.\n\nChirdan et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with an incarcerated umbilical hernia. They discuss how most patients with hernias resolve spontaneously before 5 years of age but a small number will have incarcerated hernias that require surgery earlier. They recommend active observation of patients to diagnose incarceration earlier.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Elective surgical management later on in childhood is usually not required to manage umbilical hernias as most umbilical hernias in patients less than 5 years of age close spontaneously. Hernias that persist past age 5 can be closed surgically in an elective fashion.\n\nAnswer C: Histopathologic evaluation would be the most appropriate next step in management if the patient had an unknown umbilical mass, such as an umbilical granuloma or polyp. Umbilical granulomas form shortly after birth from excess tissue at the base of the umbilicus and can be treated topically, whereas umbilical polyps are firm masses of omphalomesenteric duct or urachal embryologic remnants and require surgical excision.\n\nAnswer D: Immediate surgical management is required in patients with incarcerated hernias, but this patient\u2019s hernia is easily reducible and < 1.5 cm.

Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death.

This can be differentiated from conus medullaris syndrome, which has perianal numbness without numbness through other dermatomes (down the leg in the S1 or S2 patterns), less severe pain (cauda equina presents with more severe pain), and hyperreflexia in the knees (cauda equina presents with lower motor neuron signs in the legs which lead to decreased reflexes - though conus medullaris may present with absent ankle reflexes, the knees are typically hyperreflexic).\n\nGardner et al. review the symptoms, diagnosis, and medico-legal landscape of cauda equina syndrome. They discuss how the most frequent etiology is a large central lumbar disc herniation. They recommend being vigilant for urinary retention in patients who may have compression as many patients have urinary retention on presentation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, also known as Guillain-Barre syndrome, occurs after respiratory or gastrointestinal infections and presents with ascending paralysis and diminished reflexes. While bladder dysfunction can occur, back pain is not typical. Guillain-Barre syndrome can be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\nAnswer C: L5/S1 disc herniation affects the traversing S1 nerve root. S1 radiculopathy presents with posterolateral leg and dorsolateral foot sensory loss and absence of the ankle reflex. Typically, bowel/bladder symptoms are not present. Treatment includes decompression of the affected nerve root.\n\nAnswer D: Overflow incontinence is caused by either bladder outlet obstruction or poor bladder tone. While this could explain this patient\u2019s urinary retention, it does not account for his back pain or sensorimotor deficits. Isolated overflow incontinence can be treated with catheterization.\n\nAnswer E: Spinal stenosis presents with lower extremity claudication, characterized by pain with standing or ambulation. The pain of neurogenic claudication is characteristically relieved by spinal flexion (\u201cshopping cart sign\u201d). Sensory loss and motor weakness can be present; however, bladder dysfunction is atypical. Treatment includes surgical decompression of the area of stenosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCauda equina syndrome is characterized by impingement of 2 or more nerve roots of the cauda equina, resulting in radicular pain, bilateral lower extremity weakness, lower motor neuron signs, sensory loss in affected dermatomes, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and saddle anesthesia.",

It is common in elderly men and is the most common form of leukemia in the United States. Patients are often asymptomatic when the diagnosis is made or may present with vague constitutional symptoms including fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. It is important to note that symptoms may be subtle or absent. Other findings include non-tender lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The diagnosis is supported when the white blood cell count is >50,000/mm^3 and can be supported with a peripheral smear which will show smudge cells. The cells in CLL may be CD5, CD20, and CD23 positive. The most common cause of death in this population is infection given the lack of competent B-cells.\n\nHallek reviews CLL. They discuss updated guidelines on the diagnosis and management of CLL. They recommend the use of targeted agents in initial therapy and acknowledge the need for further clinical trials to guide therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common malignancy seen in children and presents with pancytopenia, anemia, fatigue, leukopenia (leading to recurrent infections), and thrombocytopenia (leading to bleeding). Other findings may include fever, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. Translocations in ALL include: t(12:21) which is the most common and denotes a favorable prognosis and t(9:22) (the Philadelphia chromosome) which is less common and denotes a poor prognosis\n\nAnswer B: Acute myelogenous leukemia occurs secondary to the proliferation of myeloblasts and presents in older patients. Patients will present with fatigue, malaise, weight loss, anorexia, fever, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Auer rods are frequently present on a blood smear.\n\nAnswer D: Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells and presents with a leukocyte count often >50,000/mm3. The increased myeloid lines include red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets. Many patients present in the chronic phase with minimal symptoms; however, the blast phase can lead to a hematologic emergency termed a blast crisis which may cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. This condition is more symptomatic and less common than CLL.\n\nAnswer E: Hairy cell leukemia occurs when there is a neoplastic proliferation of mature B cells with abundant cytoplasm with \u201chairy\u201d cytoplasmic processes.

Symptoms will include chronic relapsing and remitting episodes of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and nausea. Physical exam, audiometry, and vestibular testing can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

Radiographs of the spine will show squaring of vertebrae with vertical or marginal syndesmophytes resulting in a \"bamboo spine\" appearance. The earliest radiographic sign is the erosion of the iliac side of the sacroiliac joint, but this finding is not sensitive in the early stages of the disease. MRI is sensitive in detecting sacroiliac inflammation, which makes this the best modality for early detection of ankylosing spondylitis in young patients. Initial therapy for ankylosing spondylitis includes lifestyle modifications (exercise, smoking cessation, physical therapy) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Therapy for patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs includes tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) and interleukin 17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab).\n\nJung et al. studied whether signs of inflammation on MRI are correlated with bone quality in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The authors find that bone marrow edema is negatively correlated with the trabecular bone score. The authors recommend control of active bone inflammation to prevent osteoporosis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bone scan will show inflammation in the sacroiliac joints, but this study lacks specificity for this disease compared with other inflammatory forms of arthritis.\n\nAnswer B: CT will show bony changes but not active inflammation, so it is most commonly used to diagnose cervical fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

They will typically experience lower back pain that can be described as radicular. The pain will typically travel down the legs or \"shoot down\" the legs and is typically described as feeling electrical. The straight leg test on physical exam supports the diagnosis without an MRI. When the individual raises their leg, this causes compression of the spinal nerve roots leading to an exacerbation of symptoms. The most appropriate initial step in management for these patients is limiting strenuous activity, physical therapy, and NSAIDs. Patients who have chronic symptoms that have failed conservative management can undergo surgical laminectomy.\n\nCamino and Piuzzi present the data regarding the diagnostic value of the straight leg raise test.

Piriformis syndrome presents with lower back pain similar to a herniated disc; however, is less likely to have occurred after a single lifting episode and does not typically present with electrical pain that originates in the buttocks.\n\nAnswer C: Palpating the paraspinal muscles is a non-specific test that could further support a diagnosis of a muscle strain. It will likely not provide much information in the diagnosis of a herniated disc. Patients with muscle strain can be treated conservatively with relative rest and NSAIDs.\n\nAnswer D: Radiography is unlikely to offer information regarding this patient's herniated disc. While it can detect bony abnormalities, the detail of this imaging modality will not depict a herniated disc. An MRI is required to offer the detail necessary to make the diagnosis and is the most accurate test for a herniated disc.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA herniated disc typically presents with pain in the lower back that radiates down the legs and is exacerbated by the straight leg raise test.",

The most appropriate initial management for patients in ADHF is a loop diuretic such as furosemide.\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a condition in which the heart does not pump effectively and can be due to either difficulty with relaxation in diastole or contraction in systole or a combination of both. Risk factors for this condition include myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, valvular disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. Left-sided HF leads to decreased forward flow into the systemic circulation and increased congestion in the pulmonary circulation which clinically manifests as shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, and crackles on lung exam. Early pulmonary edema leads to a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch which causes hypoxia. Hypoxia leads to a compensatory increase in the respiratory rate, which leads to hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis. The most appropriate initial treatment for patients in ADHF is a loop diuretic such as furosemide, which helps alleviate fluid overload. Other treatments for acute exacerbations may include nitroglycerin (in hypertensive patients) and BIPAP.\n\nYancy et al. discuss the most recent ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of heart failure. They review current testing and treatment regimens. Acute episodes may be managed with loop diuretics to reduce volume overload and improve symptoms.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ivabradine inhibits the funny current, an electrical current that leads to spontaneous depolarization in pacemaker cells, leading to decreased heart rate. It reduces the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, it should not be started in ADHF due to lack of mortality benefit and should be held in ADHF patients with severe decompensation due to decreased heart rate leading to decreased cardiac output.\n\nAnswer C: Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that reduces mortality when used in patients with chronic HFrEF. However, beta-blockers can worsen decompensated HFrEF due to negative inotropy and should not be started in ADHF.\n\nAnswer D: Sacubitril and valsartan is a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that improves mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF. ARNIs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be started in ADHF due to concern for hypotension and worsening renal function. However, either an ARNI, ACE inhibitor or ARB should be started prior to discharge.\n\nAnswer E: Spironolactone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that reduces mortality in chronic HFrEF. However, high-dose spironolactone does not improve outcomes as first-line therapy in ADHF (Anstrom et al.

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin.

These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction.

Given that he has no other associated injuries, trephination is the only management indicated.\n\nA subungual hematoma occurs after trauma to the finger leading to a collection of blood under the fingernail. Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children. The authors find that there was no difference in complications or outcomes between nail bed repair and trephination; however, the cost in the nail trephination group was lower.

Common etiologies include idiopathic, post-viral, post-cardiac surgery, post-radiation, tuberculosis-related, or connective tissue disorder-related. It presents as right heart failure including symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain relieved by leaning forward, progressive peripheral edema, and ascites. A physical exam will identify an early diastolic pericardial knock, pericardial calcifications on chest radiograph, and jugular venous distension (JVD). Kussmaul sign can also occur where the JVD paradoxically rises during inspiration instead of falling. The diagnosis is supported with echocardiography. Management may require pericardiectomy for severe cases.\n\nWelch and Oh review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of constrictive pericarditis. They discuss how this disease can be evaluated using a cardiac MRI. They recommend surgical pericardiectomy in many cases.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a frontal chest radiograph with pericardial calcifications (red circle). These findings are consistent with constrictive pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can present similarly to constrictive pericarditis. Hypotension and pulsus paradoxus (a greater than 10 mmHg decrease in the systolic blood pressure during inspiration), will commonly present in patients with cardiac tamponade. A chest radiograph will show an enlarged cardiac silhouette rather than calcifications in some cases. Treatment is with emergent pericardial decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Cirrhosis can present with ascites and peripheral edema, but will not have a marked elevation in jugular venous pressure. Cirrhosis is the end-stage result of many hepatic pathologies. Treatment is with the control of sequelae such as hepatic encephalopathy and venous congestion.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, like constrictive pericarditis, can present with exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and peripheral edema if it progresses to right ventricular failure. A chest radiograph may show enlarged central pulmonary arteries and peripheral pulmonary vessels. Treatment is with reduction of pulmonary pressure such as with endothelin inhibitors.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy can also present as right heart failure with similar symptoms to constrictive pericarditis. A history of an infiltrative disease (e.g., amyloidosis and sarcoidosis) often favors restrictive cardiomyopathy, as does an audible S3 on a physical exam. Calcification of the pericardium on the chest radiograph is more consistent with constrictive pericarditis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nConstrictive pericarditis presents with symptoms of right heart failure, progressive peripheral edema, ascites, jugular venous distension, pericardial knock, and pericardial calcifications on a chest radiograph.",

The increased PTH results in renal phosphate wasting, increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and increased renal calcium reabsorption. It also results in increased osteoclast activity resulting in increased bone breakdown. This will lead to laboratory changes of hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia.\n\nTaniegra reviews the evidence regarding hyperparathyroidism.

This patient does not have metabolic alkalosis. Treatment is with the discontinuation of the offending agent.\n\nAnswer B: Increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D occurs in sarcoidosis which presents with cough, fatigue, and weight loss in an African American woman. Increased vitamin D by itself will result in hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia rather than hypophosphatemia. Treatment is supportive and/or with corticosteroids.\n\nAnswer D: Malignancy (lung or renal cancer) is possible given this patient's presentation. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a common feature with PTH-related protein effects; however, the patient's normal urinalysis and normal chest radiograph as well as non-smoking history point more toward a diagnosis of increased PTH.\n\nAnswer E: Viral illness is possible given this patient's systemic symptoms; however, it does not explain this patient's hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia.

Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.",

        "reason": "This patient who presents with a low amplitude, 4-6 Hz resting tremor that resolves with voluntary movement and associated rigidity most likely has Parkinson disease.\n\nParkinson disease is caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the basal ganglia. This neurodegenerative process leads to movement abnormalities such as bradykinesia, \u201ccogwheel\u201d muscle rigidity (intermittently increased muscle tone with passive range of motion), shuffling gait, postural instability, and a resting tremor sometimes referred to as \u201cpill-rolling\u201d in quality. Parkinson disease usually presents with unilateral symptoms and subsequently progresses to bilateral involvement. First-line treatment involves dopaminergic drugs such as carbidopa-levodopa. Antimuscarinic agents can also be used for symptom control.\n\nZhong et al. review the role of the cerebellum in tremor in Parkinson disease. The authors find that the cerebellum may modulate tremor amplitude via cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits. The authors recommend further study of the cerebellum as an alternative therapeutic target in Parkinson patients with dopamine-resistant tremors.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cerebellar stroke can manifest as an intention tremor, which presents as an oscillatory tremor that increases in amplitude at the endpoint of visually goal-directed movement. Intention tremors are best exhibited in the finger-nose-finger test in which the patient repeatedly touches their nose and then extends their arm to touch the examiner's finger. Patients would also have more severe symptoms including ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus.\n\nAnswer B: Essential tremor is a condition that is often familial and presents as a high frequency (4-9 Hz) tremor that occurs with sustained posture and is worsened with movement. Treatment includes propranolol and primidone.\n\nAnswer C: Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat disorder that leads to neurodegeneration of the caudate and putamen. Chorea is a hallmark movement abnormality associated with Huntington disease and presents with spontaneous, jerking, purposeless involuntary movements.\n\nAnswer D: Lacunar stroke can result in ischemia to the subthalamic nucleus and produce hemiballismus. This presents as spontaneous unilateral explosive movements of an upper extremity and occasionally the ipsilateral lower extremity. Other motor deficits are also expected when there is a lacunar infarct.\n\nBullet Summary:\nResting tremor is a hallmark of Parkinson disease and presents with low amplitude, 4-6 Hz oscillatory rhythmic movements that temporarily extinguish with voluntary movement.",
