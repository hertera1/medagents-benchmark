            "Tooth formation involves the development of lobes, which are the distinct sections of the tooth that contribute to its overall shape and structure. \n\n1. **Understanding Lobes**: Teeth typically develop from multiple lobes. Each lobe contributes to the cusp or the overall contour of the tooth.\n\n2. **Types of Teeth**: Different types of teeth have different numbers of lobes. For example:\n   - Incisors usually develop from 1 lobe.\n   - Canines typically develop from 1 lobe.\n   - Premolars generally develop from 2 or more lobes.\n   - Molars can develop from 3 or more lobes.\n\n3. **Minimum Requirement**: The question asks for the minimum number of lobes required to form a tooth. Since incisors and canines can form from just 1 lobe, this indicates that 1 lobe is sufficient to form a tooth.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the minimum number of lobes required to form a tooth is:\n\n(A) 1",
            "Tooth formation involves the development of lobes, which are the distinct growth areas that contribute to the shape and structure of the tooth. \n\n1. **Understanding Lobes**: Teeth typically develop from multiple lobes that fuse together.

For example:\n   - Incisors usually develop from 1 or 2 lobes.\n   - Canines typically develop from 1 lobe.\n   - Premolars generally develop from 2 or more lobes.\n   - Molars can develop from 4 or more lobes.\n\n3. **Minimum Requirement**: The question asks for the minimum number of lobes required to form a tooth. The simplest tooth, which is a canine, can be formed from just 1 lobe.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since a tooth can be formed from as few as 1 lobe, the minimum number of lobes required to form a tooth is 1.\n\nFinal answer: (A) 1",

            "To determine the appropriate primary cutting edge angle according to G.V. Black's instrument formula, we need to consider the function and design of dental cutting instruments.\n\n1. **Understanding Primary Cutting Edge Angle**: The primary cutting edge angle is the angle formed between the cutting edge of the instrument and the surface being cut. This angle is crucial for the efficiency of cutting and the control of the instrument.\n\n2. **G.V. Black's Principles**: G.V. Black established principles for dental instruments, emphasizing that the cutting edges should be designed to facilitate effective cutting while minimizing trauma to the surrounding tissues.\n\n3. **Optimal Cutting Edge Angle**: A primary cutting edge angle that is too steep (greater than 90 degrees) would lead to ineffective cutting, as the instrument would not engage the tooth structure properly. Conversely, an angle that is too shallow (less than 50 degrees) may lead to excessive wear and less control.\n\n4. **Common Practice**: In dental practice, a primary cutting edge angle that is less than 90 degrees is generally preferred. This allows for effective engagement with the tooth structure while maintaining control over the instrument.\n\nBased on these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Less than 90 degree",

However, it would not cause an increase in TT.\n\n(C) **Liver disease**: This would usually lead to decreased levels of multiple clotting factors, including fibrinogen, which is not the case here.\n\n(D) **Vitamin K deficiency**: This affects factors II, VII, IX, and X, leading to increased PT and APTT. TT may also be prolonged due to the effect on factor II (prothrombin). Fibrinogen levels are typically normal in vitamin K deficiency.\n\nGiven the combination of increased PT, APTT, and TT with normal fibrinogen and platelet counts, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Final Answer: (D) Vitamin K deficiency**"

Muscles like the masseter and temporalis are responsible for this action.\n   - **Depression**: This action lowers the mandible, opening the jaw. The digastric and mylohyoid muscles are involved in this action.\n   - **Retraction**: This action pulls the mandible backward. The temporalis (posterior fibers) and the digastric can assist in this movement.\n   - **Protraction**: This action moves the mandible forward.

The centric holding cusp is typically the cusp that provides the most support and stability during occlusion.\n\n3. **Maxillary and Mandibular Molars**: \n   - The maxillary first molar has a prominent mesiobuccal cusp, which is often considered a centric holding cusp because it interdigitates with the opposing mandibular molars.\n   - The mandibular first molar has a mesiobuccal cusp that occludes with the maxillary molars, but the mesiolingual cusp of the mandibular first molar also plays a significant role in occlusion.\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) Mesiobuccal cusp of maxillary 1st molar: This cusp is known for its role in occlusion and is often considered a centric holding cusp.\n   - (B) Mesiolingual cusp of mandibular first molar: While important, it is not typically referred to as the centric holding cusp.\n   - (C) Distolingual cusp of mandibular 1st molar: This cusp does not play a significant role in centric occlusion.\n   - (D) Mesiopalatal cusp of maxillary 1st molar: This cusp is not typically referred to as a centric holding cusp.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(A) Mesiobuccal cusp of maxillary 1st molar"

The patient has competent lips at rest, which means the lips are closed and not overly strained.\n2. The lip line is described as being opposite the tips of the upper incisors. This indicates that when the lips are at rest, the upper lip is aligned with the tips of the upper front teeth (incisors).\n3. In dental terminology, a lip line that is opposite the tips of the upper incisors is typically considered to be at an average position. \n\nBased on this reasoning, the lip line is best described as:\n\n(A) Average"

            "To determine which marker shows a holocrine gland, we need to understand the characteristics of holocrine glands. Holocrine glands are a type of exocrine gland where the entire cell disintegrates to release its secretion. This means that the glandular cells accumulate their secretions until they rupture, releasing the entire cell contents.\n\n1. **Identify the characteristics of holocrine glands**: \n   - The cells are typically larger and more rounded.\n   - The glandular cells will appear to be filled with secretory material.\n   - There may be signs of cell disintegration or debris in the lumen of the gland.\n\n2. **Examine the options**: \n   - Without visual aids, we cannot directly assess the markers A, B, C, or D. However, if we had images or descriptions of these markers, we would look for the features mentioned above.\n\n3. **Select the most likely option**: \n   - If one of the options shows cells that appear to be bursting or filled with secretory material, that would likely indicate a holocrine gland.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the final answer is:\n\n(C) C",

            "To determine how long NiTi files should be submerged in NaOCl at 122\u00b0F to prevent damage from corrosion, we need to consider the effects of temperature and the concentration of NaOCl on NiTi files.\n\n1. **Understanding NiTi Files**: Nickel-titanium (NiTi) files are commonly used in endodontics for root canal treatment. They are known for their flexibility and resistance to fracture, but they can be susceptible to corrosion, especially when exposed to certain chemicals like sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl).\n\n2. **Effect of Temperature**: The temperature of 122\u00b0F (approximately 50\u00b0C) is relatively high for chemical exposure. Higher temperatures can accelerate the corrosion process of metals, including NiTi.\n\n3. **Corrosion Timeframes**: Research and clinical guidelines suggest that prolonged exposure to NaOCl can lead to significant corrosion of NiTi files. The specific timeframes for safe exposure can vary, but it is generally recommended to limit the exposure time to minimize the risk of corrosion.\n\n4. **Evaluating Options**: \n   - (A) 20 mins: This is a relatively short exposure time and is likely safe.\n   - (B) 45 mins: This is longer but may still be acceptable depending on the concentration of NaOCl.\n   - (C) 60 mins: This is approaching a critical exposure time where corrosion could become a concern.\n   - (D) 2 hours: This is a long exposure time and is likely to cause significant corrosion.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding of the effects of NaOCl on NiTi files and the temperature involved, the safest option to prevent damage from corrosion would be the shortest exposure time.\n\nFinal answer: (A) 20 mins",
