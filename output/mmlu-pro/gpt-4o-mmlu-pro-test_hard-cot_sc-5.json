She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers.

On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg.

Heat stroke is a medical emergency that requires rapid cooling to prevent organ damage and other complications.

Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L.

This suggests that the patient's mother is likely a carrier.\n\n2. **Mother's Creatine Kinase Levels**: The patient's mother has an elevated creatine kinase concentration, which is often seen in carriers of DMD due to subclinical muscle damage.\n\n3. **Patient's Creatine Kinase Levels**: The patient's creatine kinase concentration is within the normal range, but this alone is not sufficient to rule out carrier status because carriers can have normal levels.\n\n4. **Genetic Analysis**: Genetic analysis was not performed on the deceased relatives, making it difficult to definitively determine the patient's carrier status without further genetic testing.\n\nGiven these points, the most appropriate assessment is that the patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain due to the lack of genetic analysis on her deceased relatives. This aligns with option (D).\n\nTherefore, the most consistent and reliable solution is:\nD",
