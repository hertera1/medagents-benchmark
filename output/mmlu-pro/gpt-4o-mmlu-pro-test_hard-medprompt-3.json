The candidate solutions provided all suggest \"Tapering\" as the answer. However, tapering is not a nutritional strategy; it is a training strategy involving the reduction of exercise intensity and volume before a competition to allow the body to recover and perform optimally.\n\nSince the problem specifically asks for nutritional strategies, and tapering does not fit this category, none of the provided solutions directly address the problem correctly. Therefore, none of the options (0, 1, 2) are appropriate answers to the problem as stated.\n\nGiven the context, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misalignment in the provided solutions. If I must choose from the given options, I would select option 0, 1, or 2 as they are identical, but it is important to note that the correct answer should involve a nutritional strategy, not tapering.",
