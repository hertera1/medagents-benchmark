        "question": "A 64-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a headache and nausea. He reports that he was rocking his grandson to sleep when the symptoms began. He states the pain is constant and is primarily located on his right side. When asked to indicate the area of pain, he says that it surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/91 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient\u2019s right eye is shown in Figure A. Upon physical examination, the right pupil is minimally responsive to light and the globe feels firm. A right-sided carotid bruit is appreciated.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden-onset unilateral vision loss and an orbitofrontal headache with a dilated pupil and a hard ocular globe suggesting a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",

Her mother says that last night her daughter felt ill, and her condition has been worsening. Her daughter experienced a severe headache and had a stiff neck. This morning she was minimally responsive, vomited several times, and produced a small amount of dark cloudy urine. The patient was born at 39 weeks and met all her developmental milestones.

This abnormal concentration of infections when the patient is with her mother suggests a diagnosis of intentional contamination.\n\nFactitious disorder by proxy (formerly Munchausen syndrome) occurs when 1 individual creates symptoms in another for attention. Typically, this is a parent feigning or creating symptoms in a child in order to receive the psychiatric gain of attention from healthcare personnel. The patient should be treated and removed from the parents as this is considered child abuse. Factitious disorder by proxy should be suspected in any pediatric patient who has repeat infections that are atypical or not expected epidemiologically. Patients should also be evaluated for organic causes of symptoms such as immunodeficiency syndromes.\n\nAbeln and Love review the evidence regarding the diagnosis of factitious disorder by proxy. They discuss how these disorders have high morbidity and mortality when not accurately recognized. They recommend paying attention to red flags such as abnormal constellations of symptoms.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Gastroenteritis would present with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; however, it would not present with sepsis routinely. Gastroenteritis does not best explain the most likely underlying cause of this patient's presentation.\n\nAnswer B: Immunodeficiency such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) would present with lifelong infections from birth that are bacterial, viral, and fungal. Immunodeficiency would not present with repeat infections in a pediatric patient only when they are with one patient.\n\nAnswer D: Meningitis would present with headache, altered mental status, and meningeal signs. In the setting of repeat sepsis in a healthy pediatric patient, intentional contamination is more likely. Similarly, an absence of photophobia and no further history/physical exam supporting this diagnosis suggests an alternative diagnosis.\n\nAnswer E: Urinary tract infection would present with dysuria rather than repeat episodes of sepsis. Though a urinary tract infection could lead to sepsis, this would be rare and more likely to occur in an immunosuppressed patient, the elderly, or a neonate. UTIs are a common cause of infection and fever in pediatric patients.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFactitious disorder by proxy occurs when 1 individual feigns or creates symptoms in another.",

Unlikely given the presentation.\n   - **Immunodeficiency (B)**: Could explain recurrent infections, but the patient is up to date on vaccinations and met developmental milestones, suggesting normal immune function.\n   - **Intentional contamination (C)**: The history of recurrent infections when with her mother but not with her father raises suspicion. This could explain recurrent infections and unusual presentation.\n   - **Meningitis (D)**: Symptoms like severe headache, stiff neck, fever, and altered mental status are classic for meningitis. However, the recurrent nature of infections and the specific context provided suggest another underlying issue.\n   - **Urinary tract infection (E)**: She has a history of UTIs, but the current presentation is more severe and systemic, suggesting something beyond a simple UTI.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The recurrent nature of infections, particularly when with her mother, and the unusual presentation suggest intentional contamination. This aligns with the father's observation that she does not get sick when he takes care of her, pointing towards a possible case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy or similar intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate underlying explanation for this patient's presentation is:\n\n**C) Intentional contamination**",

He was outside tending to his lawn for several hours in the heat, when he stood up suddenly from pulling weeds and fainted. He denies any preceding symptoms and returned to baseline within 1 minute. The patient is not aware of any medical problems and just started seeing a primary care physician last week. He recently used a friend's prescription for ondansetron for nausea. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg, pulse is 107/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after syncope, likely secondary to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension given his outdoor gardening in the heat and symptoms when standing up rapidly. The patient\u2019s ECG reveals deep, pathologic Q waves, which in this case are an incidental finding indicative of a previous myocardial infarction or a previous ischemic event.\n\nThe Q wave is a negative deflection just prior to the R wave. Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI. They recommend testing such as cardiac MRI to assess for previous infarction in the appropriate patient population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating pathologic Q waves (red arrows). Note the deep and wide Q waves; this raises concern for a past ischemic event.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute myocardial infarctions would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG with possible reciprocal depressions. While T wave inversions may be indicative of new or acute ischemia, deep pathologic Q waves without ST elevation are indicative of previous infarction.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia would cause U waves on ECG, which appear as a small, \"second T wave\" after the initial T wave. Note they are not U-shaped despite their name. Management is centered on repletion of potassium and often magnesium as well.\n\nAnswer C: Intermittent torsades de pointes can cause syncope and should be suspected in a patient with syncope in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This patient\u2019s QT interval is not particularly prolonged, and his syncope seems to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Management is centered on cessation of QT-prolonging medications and magnesium administration. Note that while ondansetron does prolong the QT interval, it is unlikely to cause torsades given the patient took it a week ago.\n\nAnswer E: Pulmonary emboli would present on ECG with sinus tachycardia in addition to pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia. Note that the ECG is a nonspecific test for pulmonary emboli, and CT angiography is the preferred confirmatory test for this condition. Syncope is a possible presentation of larger pulmonary emboli (though the patient would also be hemodynamically unstable).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPathologic Q waves are indicative of a previous myocardial infarction.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's ECG, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient fainted after standing up suddenly while working in the heat. This suggests a possible vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension due to dehydration or heat exposure. However, the key here is the ECG findings.\n\n2. **Medication Use**: The patient used ondansetron, which is known to potentially cause QT interval prolongation. This is important because prolonged QT can lead to torsades de pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**: The patient has a slightly elevated temperature, elevated pulse rate, and normal oxygen saturation. These findings are not specific but indicate hemodynamic stability post-syncope.\n\n4. **Physical Exam**: The exam is largely unremarkable, with no neurological deficits or abdominal issues.\n\n5. **ECG Analysis**: The question does not provide the ECG image, but based on the context, we need to consider the effects of ondansetron. If the ECG shows QT interval prolongation, this could lead to torsades de pointes.\n\n6. **Diagnosis Options**:\n   - (A) Acute myocardial infarction: Typically presents with chest pain and specific ECG changes like ST elevation or depression, which are not mentioned here.\n   - (B) Hypokalemia: Can cause ECG changes like U waves, but the scenario does not suggest electrolyte imbalance.\n   - (C) Intermittent torsades des pointes: Given the use of ondansetron and the fainting episode, this is a plausible diagnosis if the ECG shows QT prolongation.\n   - (D) Previous myocardial ischemia: Would not typically cause syncope without other symptoms and would show different ECG changes.\n   - (E) Pulmonary embolism: Usually presents with respiratory symptoms and specific ECG changes, not mentioned here.\n\nConsidering the use of ondansetron and the potential for QT prolongation leading to torsades de pointes, the most likely diagnosis based on the ECG is:\n\n(C) Intermittent torsades des pointes",
        "thinking": "Based on the patient's use of ondansetron, which is known to cause QT interval prolongation, and the fainting incident, the most likely diagnosis relates to the effects that can arise from this drug. Torsades de pointes is linked to prolonged QT, and this aligns with the context given. The other options either do not fit the clinical signs or do not correlate with the medication's known effects.

        "reason": "This patient presents following a motor vehicle accident with a tender abdomen and stable vital signs. Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding. This stable patient with a benign exam can undergo a CT scan, which will offer more data than a FAST exam and would be performed regardless of whether a FAST exam was positive or negative given this patient's intoxication and abdominal bruising.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient who has experienced blunt abdominal trauma the most appropriate initial step in a stable patient is an abdominal CT scan.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most appropriate next step in management for this patient, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident, which is a common cause of blunt trauma. The impact was at 25 miles per hour, which can cause significant internal injuries even if external signs are not immediately apparent.\n\n2. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is disoriented, which could be due to head injury, intoxication, or shock. He has multiple lacerations and bruising over the abdomen, but no tenderness, distension, or rigidity. The lack of abdominal tenderness or rigidity suggests that there may not be immediate signs of internal bleeding or organ damage, but this does not rule out the possibility of internal injury.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**: His vital signs are relatively stable, with a normal temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rate. This stability suggests that he is not in immediate shock, but close monitoring is necessary.\n\n4. **Alcohol and Marijuana**: The smell of alcohol and marijuana indicates possible intoxication, which can affect his level of consciousness and complicate the assessment.\n\n5. **Diagnostic Options**:\n   - **Abdominal and chest CT (A)**: Provides detailed imaging and is useful for identifying internal injuries, but may not be immediately necessary given the current stability and lack of severe symptoms.\n   - **Chest radiograph anterior-posterior and lateral (B)**: Useful for assessing chest injuries but does not address potential abdominal trauma.\n   - **Diagnostic laparoscopy (C)**: Invasive and typically reserved for when there is a strong suspicion of intra-abdominal injury that requires surgical intervention.\n   - **Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (D)**: An invasive procedure to detect internal bleeding, but less commonly used now due to advances in imaging.\n   - **Focused abdominal sonography for trauma exam (E)**: FAST exam is a rapid, non-invasive bedside ultrasound used to assess for free fluid (blood) in the abdomen, which is particularly useful in trauma settings.\n\nGiven the patient's mechanism of injury, presence of abdominal bruising, and the need for a quick assessment of potential internal bleeding, the **Focused abdominal sonography for trauma exam (FAST exam)** is the most appropriate next step.

These treatments aim to reduce inflammation, unclog pores, and decrease bacterial growth.\n\n3. **Follow-up**: After 1 month of treatment, the patient reports no significant improvement. This suggests that the current topical regimen might not be sufficient for his acne severity.\n\n4. **Next Step in Management**: \n   - **Option A (Continue current therapy for 1 more month)**: While acne treatments can take time to show results, if there is no improvement after 1 month, it is reasonable to consider adjusting the treatment plan rather than continuing the same regimen.\n   - **Option B (Dietary intervention)**: Although diet can influence acne, dietary changes alone are unlikely to be the most effective next step in management for persistent acne.\n   - **Option C (Isoretinoin)**: Isotretinoin is typically reserved for severe, nodulocystic acne or acne that is resistant to other treatments due to its potential side effects. It might be premature to consider isotretinoin at this stage.\n   - **Option D (Oral antibiotics)**: Oral antibiotics can be an appropriate next step for moderate to severe acne that does not respond to topical treatments. They help reduce bacterial load and inflammation.\n   - **Option E (Topical antibiotics)**: Topical antibiotics could be considered, but given the lack of response to current topical treatments, oral antibiotics might be more effective.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient, who has not responded to topical treatments, is to introduce oral antibiotics to help manage his acne.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**D) Oral antibiotics**",

This presentation is consistent with Dressler syndrome and the most appropriate initial step in management is aspirin.\n\nDressler syndrome is pericarditis that can occur after a myocardial infarction (MI). It most commonly occurs weeks to months after the MI, but can also occur within 1 week from an MI in rare cases. It is believed to result from an autoimmune reaction that occurs after damage to the heart (surgery and MI). It presents with chest pain, fever, pleuritic pain, and a pericardial friction rub. ECG demonstrates diffuse ST elevation with PR depression consistent with pericarditis. The most appropriate initial step in the management of this condition is symptomatic management with aspirin.\n\nLeib et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Dressler syndrome. They discuss how this condition is secondary pericarditis with or without pericardial effusion resulting from injury to the heart or pericardium. They recommend considering this syndrome in all patients with chest pain after a myocardial infarction.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an ECG with ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF (blue circles) suggesting a diagnosis of right-sided MI.\n\nFigure/Illustration B demonstrates an ECG with diffuse ST elevation and PR depression (blue circles) suggesting a diagnosis of pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 5: Angiography and stenting would be appropriate management if this patient were experiencing a repeat MI. The diffuse ST elevation and PR depression seen several days after his myocardial infarction are more indicative of pericarditis rather than a repeat MI. In addition, the chest pain the patient is experiencing can also occur in pericarditis and obfuscates the diagnosis of repeat MI.\n\nAnswers 3 & 4: Ibuprofen, other NSAIDs, and corticosteroids such as prednisone are not first-line therapy in post-MI pericarditis as they can hinder the healing and remodeling process of the myocardium. Current guidelines dictate that they may be used in cases that are refractory to initial therapy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDressler syndrome (post-MI pericarditis) presents with chest pain, pericardial friction rub, fever, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG, and should be treated initially with aspirin.",

The pain radiating to the left arm further supports this.\n\n2. **Medical History**: The patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. His medications (insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide) are consistent with managing these conditions.\n\n3. **Initial ECG and Vital Signs**: The initial ECG (Figure A) likely showed changes indicative of myocardial infarction, given the context. His vital signs show tachycardia (pulse 112/min) and hypotension (blood pressure 100/70 mmHg), which can occur during a cardiac event.\n\n4. **Management and Admission**: The patient was appropriately managed and admitted to the step-down unit, suggesting initial stabilization and treatment for myocardial infarction, possibly including medications like aspirin, anticoagulants, and possibly reperfusion therapy.\n\n5. **Repeat Chest Pain and ECG**: Two days later, the patient experiences chest pain again, prompting a repeat ECG (Figure B). This suggests a possible complication or progression of the underlying cardiac condition.\n\n6. **Next Step in Management**: Given the recurrence of chest pain and the need to address the underlying condition, the most appropriate next step would be to further evaluate the coronary arteries to determine the cause of the recurrent pain and assess for any blockages or complications.\n\n- **Angiography (A)**: This is a diagnostic procedure that visualizes the coronary arteries and can identify blockages or complications. It is often used to guide further treatment decisions, such as stenting or bypass surgery.\n\n- **Aspirin (B)**: While aspirin is important in the management of myocardial infarction, the recurrence of chest pain suggests a need for further investigation rather than just medication.\n\n- **Ibuprofen (C) and Prednisone (D)**: These are anti-inflammatory medications and are not typically used in the acute management of myocardial infarction or recurrent chest pain related to coronary artery disease.\n\n- **Stenting (E)**: This is a therapeutic procedure that follows angiography if a significant blockage is found.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral cataracts most likely has classic galactosemia. Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding. The author notes that there are safety concerns with regards to the high phyto-estrogenic isoflavone content of these formulas. The author recommends that despite these safety concerns, these formulas should still be used in patients with classic galactosemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods would be effective in the treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance. This disease presents similarly to classic galactosemia, but cataracts would not be seen in patients with this disease.\n\nAnswer C: Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement would be effective in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, associated findings in this disease would be anemia and avascular necrosis of the bones.\n\nAnswer D: Removing phenylalanine from the maternal diet during pregnancy would be effective in the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, these patients classically present with a \"musty smell\" and eczema.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 supplementation may be effective in mitigating the negative symptoms of homocystinuria. This disease may also present with cataracts or lens dislocations. Associated findings in this disorder would be marfanoid appearance and arachnodactyly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with classic galactosemia should not be breastfed and should receive a galactose-free and lactose-free diet such as soy-based formulas.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with acute acetaminophen intoxication. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting. In general, syrup of ipecac is the wrong answer choice for all toxicity cases.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAcetaminophen toxicity should be treated immediately with N-acetyl cysteine followed by further diagnostic workup including serum acetaminophen levels.",

She is not currently on any medications, but she has taken acetaminophen, according to her statement. The family found her with an empty pill bottle, but they are unsure of the contents.\n\n3. **Acetaminophen Overdose Consideration**: Acetaminophen overdose can lead to liver toxicity, but the patient claims she only took a few pills. However, the family insists the bottle was new, suggesting a potential for a significant overdose.\n\n4. **Immediate Concerns**: The primary concern in acetaminophen overdose is liver damage, which can be prevented by early administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), especially if the overdose is confirmed or suspected.\n\n5. **Diagnostic and Treatment Steps**:\n   - **Blood Acetaminophen Levels (A)**: This is crucial to confirm the level of acetaminophen in the blood and assess the risk of toxicity. It helps guide the need for NAC.\n   - **Charcoal (B)**: Activated charcoal can be used to prevent absorption of the drug if the ingestion was recent (usually within 1-2 hours), but the patient was found 3 hours ago, making this less effective.\n   - **Lactated Ringer Bolus (C)**: This is not directly relevant to acetaminophen overdose management.\n   - **N-acetylcysteine (D)**: This is the antidote for acetaminophen toxicity and should be administered if there is a high suspicion of overdose or confirmed high levels.\n   - **Syrup of Ipecac (E)**: This is not recommended for acetaminophen overdose and is generally not used in modern practice due to risks and inefficacy.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the uncertainty about the amount ingested and the potential for serious liver damage, the most appropriate immediate step is to measure blood acetaminophen levels to confirm the overdose and guide further treatment, including the possible administration of NAC.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**(A) Blood acetaminophen levels**",

Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones.

They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis. She does not report symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (joint pain/stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with use).\n\nBullet Summary:\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis is treated with alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate).",
        "raw_response": "To answer this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory findings step-by-step:\n\n1. **Symptoms and History:**\n   - The patient presents with muscle weakness, particularly in the lower extremities, and increased urinary frequency.\n   - She has a history of calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis, rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate, and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin.\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings:**\n   - Serum electrolytes show hypokalemia (K+: 2.9 mEq/L), which is significantly low and can cause muscle weakness.\n   - Metabolic acidosis is indicated by low bicarbonate (HCO3-: 18 mEq/L) and normal anion gap (Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-) = 137 - (106 + 18) = 13).\n   - Urine pH is 5.6, which is relatively acidic.\n\n3. **Diagnosis Consideration:**\n   - The combination of hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and nephrolithiasis suggests a possible renal tubular acidosis (RTA), likely distal RTA (type 1), which is associated with the inability to acidify urine and can lead to nephrolithiasis.\n\n4. **Management:**\n   - The immediate concern is the hypokalemia, which can cause muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias. Potassium replacement is crucial.\n   - The metabolic acidosis also needs to be addressed, but the primary and urgent issue is the low potassium level.\n\n5. **Options Analysis:**\n   - (A) Administer hydrochlorothiazide: Thiazide diuretics can worsen hypokalemia, so this is not appropriate.\n   - (B) Administer intravenous insulin: Insulin is used for hyperglycemia and can lower potassium further by driving it into cells, so this is not appropriate.\n   - (C) Administer intravenous sodium bicarbonate: This can help correct metabolic acidosis but does not address hypokalemia directly.\n   - (D) Begin potassium replacement therapy with dextrose: This directly addresses the hypokalemia, which is the most urgent issue.\n   - (E) Increase methotrexate dose: This is unrelated to the current symptoms and lab findings.\n\nGiven the urgency of correcting hypokalemia to prevent complications such as muscle weakness and cardiac issues, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**(D) Begin potassium replacement therapy with dextrose**",
        "thinking": "The patient's critical condition is primarily due to hypokalemia, which is causing significant muscle weakness and poses a risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, the most urgent and appropriate response is to directly address the hypokalemia with potassium replacement therapy rather than options that would exacerbate the condition or are unrelated. After evaluating all options, (D) is clearly the best choice to ensure immediate correction of potassium levels.",

Physical exam reveals a non-tender, non-distended abdomen. Laboratory studies are notable for a serum calcium of 7.0 mg/dL. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is performed as seen in Figure A. A Sudan Black stain of the patient\u2019s stool is positive.

        "reason": "This patient with a history of alcoholism is presenting with steatorrhea (foul-smelling diarrhea that stains with Sudan Black, a stain that detects fat in the stool), hypocalcemia, and findings suggestive of chronic pancreatitis on CT scan (inflammatory changes and calcification). His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism. This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea. Treating the underlying cause in addition to rifaximin will eliminate the excess bacteria.\n\nBullet Summary:\nProton pump inhibitors should be given in patients with persistent diarrhea in the setting of chronic pancreatitis to prevent the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes.",

His last drink was over a year ago.\n\n2. **Physical Exam and Lab Findings**: The patient has a non-tender, non-distended abdomen. His serum calcium is low at 7.0 mg/dL. A Sudan Black stain of the stool is positive, indicating the presence of fat in the stool (steatorrhea).\n\n3. **CT Scan and Diagnosis**: Although the CT scan image is not provided here, the combination of symptoms, history, and stool findings suggests chronic pancreatitis, likely due to his history of alcoholism. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to pancreatic insufficiency, resulting in malabsorption and steatorrhea.\n\n4. **Treatment Options**: The most appropriate treatment for pancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. However, none of the options directly list pancreatic enzymes. Let's evaluate the options:\n\n   - (A) Ciprofloxacin: An antibiotic, not relevant for treating pancreatic insufficiency.\n   - (B) Loperamide: An anti-diarrheal, which does not address the underlying cause of steatorrhea.\n   - (C) Oral rehydration: Useful for dehydration but does not treat the cause of steatorrhea.\n   - (D) Pantoprazole: A proton pump inhibitor, not relevant for treating pancreatic insufficiency.\n   - (E) Rifaximin: An antibiotic used for certain types of diarrhea, not relevant for treating pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nGiven the context, none of the options directly address pancreatic enzyme replacement, which is the standard treatment for steatorrhea due to pancreatic insufficiency.

An MRI is not typically used initially due to the urgency and the need for rapid diagnosis.\n\n6. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) Amoxicillin-clavulinic acid: This is an antibiotic and not relevant for the immediate management of a suspected SAH.\n   - (B) CT of the head: This is the most appropriate initial step to diagnose or rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n   - (C) Dexamethasone: This is a steroid, often used to reduce inflammation, but not indicated as the first step in managing a suspected SAH.\n   - (D) MRI of the head: While useful for detailed imaging, it is not the first-line investigation for acute SAH due to time constraints.\n   - (E) Piperacillin-tazobactam: Another antibiotic, not relevant for the immediate management of a suspected SAH.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate initial step in management for this patient is:\n\n**(B) CT of the head**",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with bright red blood per rectum with a non-tender abdomen. Of the answer choices given, angiodysplasia is the most likely to cause such profuse and sudden bleeding.\n\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly in the colon. The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. The authors note that angiodysplasias are the cause of many \"occult\" GI bleeds not visualized on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. The authors recommend the use of capsule endoscopy in occult GI bleeds to identify angiodysplasias as a potential source.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Erosion into a gastric vessel is the pathophysiology of a bleeding gastric vessel secondary to peptic ulcer disease. This usually presents with melena (black tarry stools) rather than bright red blood per rectum. Only in cases of extremely brisk upper GI bleeding would patients present with bright red blood per rectum. Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Diverticulosis presents with bright red blood and is possible in this patient, but it does not involve inflammation or infection, which defines diverticulitis.\n\nAnswer C: Malignancy or colon cancer can present with bright red blood per rectum, malaise, weight loss, and microcytic anemia. While it is possible in this patient, his age, lack of risk factors for colon cancer, and the sudden onset of his symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.\n\nAnswer D: Submucosal esophageal (Mallory-Weiss) tear presents after profuse vomiting (as in this patient) with bloody vomitus. Treatment is supportive and involves antiemetics.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation that presents with bright red blood per rectum.",

        "reason": "This young girl with a recent history of a cat bite and difficulty walking most likely has likely Pasteurella multocida osteomyelitis. Empiric IV antibiotic therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam is the most appropriate initial management.\n\nPasteurella multocida is a gram-negative rod that is associated with cat and dog bites. Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen. Antibiotics can then be narrowed down accordingly. Patients will often require between 4-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment. MRSA coverage may initially be started and tapered later once cultures result.\n\nMollitt reviews the evidence regarding the microbiology of various injuries. He discusses how Pasteurella multocida is a common complication of animal bites. He recommends early effective antibiotic treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answer:\nAnswer A: Amoxicillin and clavulanate can be used to treat Pasteurella infection. Patients with osteomyelitis should not be treated with oral antibiotics initially, in particular, when there are systemic manifestations as is present in this patient. IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam are the mainstay for empiric osteomyelitis treatment after an animal bite in a patient with systemic manifestations.\n\nAnswer C: Doxycycline is used to treat uncomplicated chlamydia infections. Gonococcal osteomyelitis may present in sexually active individuals and may be associated with septic arthritis. Sexually active patients may be suspected of having this disease.\n\nAnswer D: Fluconazole is an antifungal that is used to treat Candida osteomyelitis. Candida osteomyelitis would be highly unusual in patients with no other risk factors. Instead, this disease is more common in immunodeficient patients or those who use IV drugs.\n\nAnswer E: Vancomycin is used for MRSA infections. Although S. aureus is the most common overall cause of osteomyelitis, this patient with a recent animal bite most likely has Pasteurella infection and this organism should be covered accordingly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with suspicion of Pasteurella osteomyelitis infection after an animal bite should be treated with empiric IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam.",

She presents with fever (102.2\u00b0F), and the wound shows signs of infection (erythema and edema). MRI confirms osteomyelitis.\n\n2. **Common Pathogens**: Cat bites can introduce bacteria such as Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococci. Pasteurella is particularly common in animal bites.\n\n3. **Antibiotic Choice**: The choice of antibiotic should cover the likely pathogens. Pasteurella multocida is sensitive to penicillin derivatives, and Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) should be considered due to the severity of the infection (osteomyelitis).\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **(A) Amoxicillin and clavulanate**: This combination is effective against Pasteurella multocida and some Staphylococcus aureus strains, but it may not cover MRSA.\n   - **(B) Ampicillin and sulbactam**: Similar to amoxicillin and clavulanate, it covers Pasteurella and some Staphylococcus aureus, but not MRSA.\n   - **(C) Doxycycline**: Effective against Pasteurella and some Staphylococcus aureus, but not typically used as first-line for osteomyelitis.\n   - **(D) Flucanozole**: An antifungal, not appropriate for bacterial infections.\n   - **(E) Vancomycin**: Effective against MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, but does not cover Pasteurella multocida.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the severity of the infection (osteomyelitis) and the need to cover MRSA, Vancomycin is the most appropriate choice.

The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications. They recommend assessing BNP levels in patients who are suspected of having CHF.\n\nFigure A is a chart with changes in brain natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, sodium, and potassium that would be seen in various diseases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, and high potassium does not reflect the changes that would be seen in CHF. Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF. This pattern would be seen in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH where excessive resorption of free water results in hemodilution.\n\nAnswer E: Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and normal potassium reflect the findings in a healthy patient. This patient most likely has CHF, which would result in increased aldosterone and ADH function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCommon lab findings in heart failure include elevated BNP, elevated ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",

Although patients with EDS may present with many of the phenotypic features of both Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria, patients are much less likely to have lens subluxation. Osteoarthritis may be seen with higher incidence in patients with homocystinuria. Treatment is with brace support of unstable joints.\n\nAnswer E: Wilms tumor is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a pediatric overgrowth disorder usually caused by a mutation at chromosome 11p15. BWS presents with macrosomia (\u201cgigantism\u201d), which is defined as height and weight > 97th percentile. BWS additionally presents with omphalocele, hemihyperplasia, visceromegaly, neonatal hypoglycemia, and other embryonal tumors, including hepatoblastoma and neuroblastoma. Treatment is with surgical correction of defects.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHomocystinuria presents with Marfanoid habitus, fair complexion, intellectual disability, downward lens subluxation, and an increased risk of thromboembolic events.",
        "raw_response": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and identify the most likely underlying condition. The key features in this case are:\n\n1. **Tall stature**: The child is in the 99th percentile for height.\n2. **Joint hypermobility and hyperelastic skin**: These are indicative of connective tissue disorders.\n3. **Downward lens subluxation**: This is a significant clue pointing towards a specific condition.\n4. **Developmental delay**: Mild developmental delay is noted.\n5. **Fair complexion and prominent sternum**: These features can be associated with certain syndromes.\n\nGiven these features, the condition that fits this presentation is **homocystinuria**. Homocystinuria is a metabolic disorder characterized by:\n\n- Tall stature and marfanoid habitus (similar to Marfan syndrome).\n- Joint hypermobility and hyperelastic skin.\n- Lens subluxation, typically downward (as opposed to upward in Marfan syndrome).\n- Developmental delay.\n- Increased risk of thromboembolic events due to elevated homocysteine levels.\n\nThe complication most associated with homocystinuria is **thromboembolic stroke** due to the increased risk of blood clots. This is a result of elevated homocysteine levels, which can damage blood vessels and increase clot formation.\n\nNow, let's match this analysis with the options provided:\n\n(A) Aortic dissection - More commonly associated with Marfan syndrome.\n(B) Medullary thyroid cancer - Associated with MEN syndromes, not homocystinuria.\n(C) Osteoarthritis - Not directly related to homocystinuria.\n(D) Thromboembolic stroke - Fits the complication profile of homocystinuria.\n(E) Wilms tumor - Associated with certain genetic syndromes, not homocystinuria.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D) Thromboembolic stroke**",
        "thinking": "The text describes several clinical features such as tall stature, joint hypermobility, lens subluxation, and developmental delay, associating them with the condition of homocystinuria. The analysis concludes that the complication most closely related to homocystinuria is thromboembolic stroke, as elevated homocysteine levels lead to increased clot formation. By evaluating the answer options against this condition, option D, thromboembolic stroke, is identified as the correct answer.",

Physical exam reveals an obtunded man covered in vomit, with track marks on his arm and several skin abscesses. The patient is given 4 liters of Ringer lactate and intravenous antibiotics. As the fourth liter of fluids is finishing, the patient is noted to have jugular venous distension and an oxygen saturation of 92% on nonrebreather. He is subsequently intubated. An ECG is obtained as seen in Figure A. The patient is started on norepinephrine, and his blood pressure is subsequently found to be 85/44 mmHg.

        "reason": "This patient who uses intravenous drugs with skin abscesses (the likely source of his infection) is hypotensive and tachycardic, with a blood pressure that is not responding to IV fluids; this is concerning for septic shock. Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor). Finally, the fourth line vasopressor for septic shock is phenylephrine.\n\nLevy et al. review sepsis. They update the Surviving Sepsis campaign which gives the most up to date management guidelines of sepsis including adequate fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors. They recommend early antibiotics and resuscitation to minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia. Note the presence of P waves (red arrows highlighting several examples) that are present throughout all leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardioversion would be appropriate in an unstable patient with unstable vital signs in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation would present with an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Cardioversion would not be indicated in sinus tachycardia.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone is a potent glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid properties. While giving an IV steroid may have a permissive effect on blood pressure (via upregulating alpha-1 receptors on the vasculature) there is no reason that this patient would have a low cortisol level (such as in chronic steroid use). Epinephrine is a better answer in this case, though steroids can be considered. Steroids are typically reserved for patients failing at least 2 vasopressors (unless they have a known cortisol-deficient state).\n\nAnswer D: Normal saline is unlikely to benefit this patient as he has already been sufficiently fluid resuscitated. Moreover, it seems the patient may be developing pulmonary edema (hypoxia, jugular venous distension), a sign of fluid overload.\n\nAnswer E: Phenylephrine is the fourth line vasopressor and is an alpha-1 agonist. It is much less potent than norepinephrine and epinephrine, and would not be started in the management of septic shock until the patient has received epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn septic shock, the vasopressors given (in order) are norepinephrine, epinephrine/vasopressin, then phenylephrine.",

He has a history of intravenous drug use, is obtunded, and has signs of possible infection (skin abscesses).\n\n2. **Initial Management**: The patient was given 4 liters of Ringer lactate and intravenous antibiotics, indicating treatment for septic shock or severe infection. Despite fluid resuscitation, he developed jugular venous distension and decreased oxygen saturation, suggesting fluid overload or heart failure.\n\n3. **Current Status**: After intubation, the patient is started on norepinephrine, a vasopressor, to address hypotension. His blood pressure improved slightly to 85/44 mmHg, but remains low.\n\n4. **ECG Consideration**: Although the ECG is not visible, the context suggests the patient is in shock, possibly septic shock, given the infection signs and drug use history. Norepinephrine is typically used in septic shock to increase vascular tone and improve blood pressure.\n\n5. **Next Step in Management**: The patient remains hypotensive despite norepinephrine. In septic shock, if norepinephrine alone is insufficient, additional vasopressors or adjunctive therapies may be considered. Hydrocortisone can be used in septic shock for patients who remain hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy, as it can help improve blood pressure by addressing potential adrenal insufficiency.\n\n6. **Evaluation of Options**:\n   - (A) Cardioversion: Not indicated as there is no mention of arrhythmia requiring cardioversion.\n   - (B) Epinephrine: Another vasopressor, but typically norepinephrine is preferred in septic shock.\n   - (C) Hydrocortisone: Used in septic shock for refractory hypotension, addressing potential adrenal insufficiency.\n   - (D) Normal saline: Additional fluids may worsen fluid overload symptoms.\n   - (E) Phenylephrine: Another vasopressor, but norepinephrine is generally preferred.\n\nGiven the context of septic shock and refractory hypotension despite norepinephrine, hydrocortisone is the most appropriate next step to potentially improve blood pressure and address adrenal insufficiency.\n\n**Answer: C) Hydrocortisone**",

        "reason": "This patient with a history of possible anabolic steroid use (wrestler with acne) who presents with right upper quadrant pain and an enhancing lesion in the liver most likely has a hepatic adenoma. The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma. They found that various molecular groups have been identified allowing for subtyping of these lesions. They recommend performing a CT scan to better characterize these lesions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT with an enhancing mass with a hypoattenuating fatty component. This is characteristically seen in large hepatic adenomas, which are solitary well-marginated lesions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole would be an effective treatment if this patient had contracted Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food or water on his recent trip to Mexico. While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma. If an adenoma is on the differential, biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of rupture and hemorrhage intraoperatively.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHepatic adenomas are benign, vascular liver masses associated with oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids that should be promptly resected if large and symptomatic.",

Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure. Further care involves blood pressure control and benzodiazepines as needed to abort seizure episodes (though note that if a patient with preeclampsia is having seizures, by definition, they have eclampsia).\n\nAl-Safi et al. discuss preeclampsia and eclampsia.

The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin). Though this is a potent antibiotic combination, neither of these takes priority over clindamycin given the possible benefit of toxin suppression from clindamycin. In this patient, clindamycin and piperacillin-tazobactam would be an appropriate antibiotic regimen.\n\nBullet Summary:\nClindamycin may suppress toxin production and should be given early in toxic shock syndrome.",

This is an ominous finding and suggests a diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) though it may also be seen in other infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis or after ischemic events. ARVD is an autosomal dominant condition where there is fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall predisposing the patient (classically younger patients) to sudden cardiac death from lethal ventricular dysrhythmias. The epsilon wave is the most specific finding; however, other findings include T wave inversion in V1-V3 or a left bundle branch appearance with frequent premature ventricular complexes among other possibilities. This is a potentially lethal diagnosis and requires management with antiarrhythmics (such as beta-blockers or amiodarone) and the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\nKayser et al. review AVRD. They note the presentation and management of ARVD and how it may present initially only with syncope. Cardiac arrest is a possible presentation as well. They recommend early detection and treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator to prevent death in this population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG with an epsilon wave (red arrow) and inverted T waves in V1/V2 (blue arrows) concerning for ARVD.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Brugada syndrome is an autosomal dominant mutation in cardiac ion channels that presents with a possible right bundle branch pattern with ST segment elevation in V1-V3 or ST coving in these same leads. It may present with syncope.\n\nAnswer C: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy presents with syncope, sudden death, or cardiac arrest in a young patient associated with exertion or dehydration. It can cause obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. A systolic murmur can be heard on cardiac auscultation and echocardiography can confirm the diagnosis. ECG will demonstrate large voltages in V1-V5.\n\nAnswer D: QT prolongation can lead to torsades des pointes which presents with twisting of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric baseline. It may present with syncope, hemodynamic instability, or cardiac arrest. Medications, infection, and congenital conditions may prolong the QT interval.\n\nAnswer E: Wolff Parkinson White syndrome presents with a delta wave on ECG or a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex. It may cause syncope and evolve into other dysrhythmias including supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) may cause syncope or cardiac arrest, and presents on ECG with an epsilon wave.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for this 7-year-old boy who has fainted several times during basketball practices, we need to consider the clinical presentation and the possible underlying cardiac conditions that could cause syncope during physical activity.\n\n1. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD)**: This condition involves the replacement of right ventricular muscle with fatty tissue, leading to arrhythmias. It typically presents in adolescents or young adults, not usually in children as young as 7 years old. The ECG might show epsilon waves, but this is less common in young children.\n\n2. **Brugada Syndrome**: This is characterized by specific ECG changes (coved ST segment elevation in leads V1-V3) and can lead to ventricular arrhythmias. It often presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death, typically in adults, but can occur in children. However, it is less likely to be triggered by exercise.\n\n3. **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)**: This condition involves thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the septum, which can obstruct blood flow and lead to syncope during exertion. It is a common cause of exercise-induced syncope in young athletes. The ECG may show left ventricular hypertrophy, deep Q waves, or other abnormalities.\n\n4. **QT Prolongation**: Long QT syndrome can lead to syncope due to torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia. The ECG would show a prolonged QT interval. Syncope can occur during exercise, but the question does not mention QT interval findings.\n\n5. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW)**: This condition involves an accessory pathway that can lead to supraventricular tachycardia. The ECG typically shows a short PR interval and a delta wave. Syncope can occur due to rapid heart rates, but it is less commonly triggered by exercise compared to HOCM.\n\nGiven the scenario, the boy's syncope during basketball practice strongly suggests a condition that is triggered by exertion. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a well-known cause of exercise-induced syncope in young athletes due to dynamic obstruction of blood flow during physical activity. The other conditions listed either do not typically present with exercise-induced syncope or are less common in this age group.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n(C) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy",
        "thinking": "The boy's fainting episodes during basketball suggest a cardiac condition that is exacerbated by physical exertion. Among the listed conditions, Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy is the most recognized cause of syncope in young athletic individuals, particularly due to its mechanism of obstructing blood flow during physical activity. The other conditions, despite having connections to syncope, are less commonly associated with exercise triggers, especially in younger children.",

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium.

Topical creams and hygiene can be used for symptomatic management of these lesions.\n\nAnswer C: Healthy dermatologic development misses the diagnosis of a cherry angioma, which although benign, is a more accurate diagnosis for this case.\n\nAnswer D: Malignant blood vessel proliferation does not describe a cherry angioma which is benign and purely cosmetic. An angiosarcoma usually occurs in deep tissues and requires surgical excision.\n\nAnswer E: Viral infection describes herpes simplex virus which would present with vesicular lesions and neurogenic pain.

He was recently exposed to his grandfather who has vesicular lesions and is being treated. This exposure suggests a possible infectious etiology, particularly a viral infection.\n\n2. **Family History**: The family history includes skin cancer, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer. While this is important for overall risk assessment, it does not directly point to the current rash.\n\n3. **Medical History**: The patient has asthma and seasonal allergies, which are not directly related to the rash but could be relevant if considering allergic or immune-mediated conditions.\n\n4. **Vital Signs**: The patient's vital signs are mostly normal, with slightly elevated blood pressure. There is no fever, which might be expected in some infectious conditions.\n\n5. **Physical Exam**: The exam reveals a rash, but without seeing Figure A, we must rely on the context provided. The grandfather's vesicular lesions suggest a viral infection, possibly herpes zoster (shingles) or varicella (chickenpox), which are characterized by vesicular rashes.\n\n6. **Diagnosis Options**:\n   - (A) Benign capillary proliferation: This would describe conditions like cherry angiomas, which are not typically associated with vesicular rashes.\n   - (B) Edema of the epidermis: This could describe conditions like eczema or contact dermatitis, but the exposure history suggests a viral etiology.\n   - (C) Healthy dermatologic development: This is not a diagnosis and does not fit the context of a concerning rash.\n   - (D) Malignant blood vessel proliferation: This would describe conditions like angiosarcoma, which are not typically associated with vesicular rashes.\n   - (E) Viral infection: Given the exposure to vesicular lesions and the context, a viral infection such as herpes zoster or varicella is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nConsidering the exposure to vesicular lesions and the nature of the rash, the most likely diagnosis is a viral infection.

He states that he has been working in a hot, humid attic all day and forgot his water bottle. He felt dizzy when standing up and then fainted and was unconscious for roughly 1 minute. He awoke at his neurologic baseline afterwards. The patient has a history of hypertension being managed by his primary care doctor. His temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 149/82 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with dizziness and syncope in the setting of likely dehydration (working in a hot/humid environment without water) and feels better after rehydration, suggesting a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block. Note the left axis deviation as suggested by the net upward deflection of the QRS in lead I and net downward deflection in lead II (blue arrows). Then, note the appearance of a right bundle branch block with the RSR pattern in aVR (black arrow) and upward R\u2019 in lead V1 (green arrow). This is a classic pattern for bifascicular block. Contrast this to the other pattern of bifascicular block which would present with a right bundle branch block and right axis deviation (upward QRS in lead II and downward in lead I), which was not seen in this case.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atrial fibrillation may occur secondary to aging, hypertension, or ischemia and presents with an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with an absence of P waves. It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection. It presents on ECG with QRS complexes that twist in amplitude around the electrical baseline. Treatment involves the administration of magnesium sulfate and, if needed, electrical cardioversion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA bifascicular block can progress to complete heart block.",

He has a history of hypertension. His vital signs are relatively stable, and he has returned to his neurologic baseline after the episode.\n\n2. **Symptoms and Context**: The fainting episode occurred after prolonged exposure to heat and physical exertion, likely leading to dehydration. Dehydration can cause orthostatic hypotension, which might explain the dizziness and fainting when standing up.\n\n3. **Physical Examination**: The patient is diaphoretic, which is consistent with dehydration and heat exposure. His cardiopulmonary and neurologic exams are unremarkable, suggesting no acute cardiac or neurological event at the time of examination.\n\n4. **ECG Consideration**: While the ECG is not provided here, we need to consider what might be expected in this scenario. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances (such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) can predispose individuals to certain arrhythmias.\n\n5. **Potential Conditions**:\n   - **Atrial Fibrillation (A)**: This is a common arrhythmia but less likely directly related to dehydration and fainting.\n   - **Complete Heart Block (B)**: This would typically present with bradycardia and more severe symptoms, not fitting the current presentation.\n   - **Myocardial Infarction (C)**: The patient does not have chest pain or other typical symptoms of an MI, and his ECG likely does not show ischemic changes.\n   - **Stroke (D)**: The patient returned to his neurologic baseline, making a stroke unlikely.\n   - **Torsades des Pointes (E)**: This is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia often associated with electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which can occur with dehydration.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the context of dehydration, the most likely arrhythmia that could occur due to electrolyte imbalance is Torsades des Pointes. This condition is associated with prolonged QT interval, which can be exacerbated by dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's history and the potential ECG findings related to dehydration, the condition most likely to occur is:\n\n(E) Torsades des pointes",

Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma. They discuss how patients often sustain these injuries from extreme sports. They recommend being aware of this syndrome so that acute interventions can be taken.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a biconvex hyperdensity that is limited by suture lines (red circle). This is the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma on head CT.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins results in a subdural hematoma (SDH). An acute SDH more commonly presents with a gradual increase in headache and confusion rather than the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome presented in this vignette. However, a minority of patients with acute SDH may have a lucid interval followed by progressive neurological decline. SDH would have a crescent-shaped appearance on head CT rather than the biconvex appearance of an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries describes a lacunar stroke. Although this patient has 2 risk factors for lacunar stroke (hypertension and smoking), this patient\u2019s head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer D: A ruptured cerebral aneurysm would most likely lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap headache\u201d), confusion or somnolence, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Surgical clipping or embolization of the bleeding vessel may be required.\n\nAnswer E: Secondary hemorrhage into a prior area of infarction usually occurs in the setting of a recent embolic stroke. Although this patient has a history of TIA and other risk factors for stroke, his head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma. Treatment is supportive with the control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nBullet Summary:\nEpidural hematomas are caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery as it passes through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone.",

A digital rectal exam may temporarily relieve the obstruction and lead to the expulsion of gas and stool (the \u201csquirt sign\u201d). Abdominal radiography typically demonstrates signs of distal intestinal obstruction such as proximal dilation and an absence of air in the rectum.

This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Duodenal atresia is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and may also present in the first 48 hours of life with bilious vomiting. The abdominal radiograph will demonstrate the \u201cdouble bubble\u201d sign, which reflects air trapping in the stomach and first portion of the duodenum. Treatment is with the surgical opening of the atretic segment.\n\nAnswer C: Intestinal malrotation may preset with bilious vomiting in a neonate due to the development of a midgut volvulus. An abdominal radiograph may show the extension of the nasogastric tube into an abnormally positioned duodenum and would not show diffuse colonic distension. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the volvulus.\n\nAnswer D: Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and also presents with delayed (> 48 hours) passing of meconium. The distal obstruction in these patients will not be temporarily relieved by a digital rectal exam. Contrast enema will demonstrate microcolon involving the entire large bowel.

Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.",

It is diffuse and crosses suture lines, typically resolving within a few days.\n   - **Cephalohematoma**: A subperiosteal hemorrhage located between the periosteum and skull. It is confined to one bone and does not cross suture lines. It may take weeks to resolve.\n   - **Subgaleal Hemorrhage**: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis. It can be extensive and cross suture lines, potentially leading to significant blood loss and complications.\n\n5. **Analysis of Symptoms**: The swelling is diffuse and ecchymotic, which is consistent with a subgaleal hemorrhage. The fact that the swelling does not change in size over 12 hours suggests it is not rapidly expanding, which can occur in severe subgaleal hemorrhages. However, the location and nature of the swelling (diffuse, ecchymotic) align with subgaleal hemorrhage, especially given the vacuum-assisted delivery.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The condition most likely affects the space between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis, which is characteristic of a subgaleal hemorrhage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Between periosteum and galea aponeurosis",
        "thinking": "The newborn's symptoms and delivery details indicate a type of scalp injury that is characterized by diffuse ecchymotic swelling not changing size, which aligns with the definition of a subgaleal hemorrhage. This is confirmed by the analysis of where the swelling occurs\u2014between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis. Therefore, the extracted answer corresponds to the correct location description.",

        "answer_idx": "B",
        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a preceding viral illness, dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop from 150/85 to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration), an echocardiogram with impaired diastolic filling, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG. This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.",

        "reason": "This patient with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is presenting with respiratory distress (increased work of breathing, hypoxia, wheezes, and crackles) in the setting of atrial fibrillation (ECG with irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves) with rapid ventricular response and pulmonary edema on chest radiograph. Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.",

His vital signs show tachycardia (pulse 140/min), tachypnea (respirations 32/min), and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation 78% on room air).\n\n2. **Physical Exam Findings**: Bilateral crackles and wheezing are noted, indicating possible pulmonary congestion and bronchospasm.\n\n3. **Initial Management**: The patient was started on BiPAP, which improved his oxygen saturation to 94%. This suggests that non-invasive ventilation is helping with his respiratory distress.\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given his history and presentation, the patient likely has acute decompensated heart failure, possibly exacerbated by COPD. The bilateral crackles suggest pulmonary edema, while wheezing could be due to COPD or cardiac asthma.\n\n5. **ECG and Chest Radiograph**: While the specific findings of the ECG and chest radiograph are not provided, they likely show signs consistent with heart failure (e.g., cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion) and possibly atrial fibrillation given the tachycardia.\n\n6. **Management Options**:\n   - **Albuterol and prednisone (A)**: This would be appropriate for COPD exacerbation, but the primary issue seems to be heart failure.\n   - **Digoxin (B)**: Used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but not typically first-line in acute settings.\n   - **Diltiazem (C)**: A calcium channel blocker used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, but can worsen heart failure due to negative inotropic effects.\n   - **Intubation (D)**: Considered if BiPAP fails or the patient deteriorates further.\n   - **Metoprolol (E)**: A beta-blocker used for rate control, but caution is needed in acute heart failure due to potential negative inotropic effects.\n\n7. **Most Appropriate Next Step**: Given the improvement with BiPAP and the likelihood of acute decompensated heart failure, the immediate focus should be on managing heart failure and controlling the heart rate if atrial fibrillation is present.

Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues. Finally, hormone replacement therapy is indicated if symptoms are refractory to all other modalities.\n\nBhupathiraju et al. studied the association between vaginal estrogen and chronic disease risk.

        "reason": "This patient's progressively increasing PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex on ECG is consistent with second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz type I, also referred to as Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nSecond degree AV block, Mobitz type I can occur in a variety of settings, such as in the context of digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or increased vagal tone. On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension. The treatment is pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSecond degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I, is characterized by progressively lengthening PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex.",

This is more serious and can cause bradycardia and palpitations.\n   - **(D) Sinus bradycardia:** A slow heart rate originating from the sinus node. Common in athletes and can be associated with palpitations due to the slow rate.\n   - **(E) Third degree atrioventricular block:** Complete heart block where atria and ventricles beat independently. This causes significant bradycardia and can be symptomatic.\n\n4. **Considerations:**\n   - The patient's pulse is 55/min, which is consistent with sinus bradycardia, especially given her fitness level.\n   - She attributes palpitations to increased caffeine intake, which can cause palpitations but not typically heart block.\n   - The absence of medication, alcohol, smoking, or drug use reduces the likelihood of heart block due to external factors.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the patient's fitness level, normal vital signs, and the pulse rate of 55/min, sinus bradycardia is the most likely diagnosis. It is common in athletes and can cause palpitations due to the slow heart rate.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**(D) Sinus bradycardia**",
        "thinking": "The patient has a bradycardic pulse of 55/min, is young and active as a fitness instructor, and experiences palpitations which could be linked to her slower heart rate. Given these aspects, sinus bradycardia aligns well with her profile. The other options involve varying degrees of heart block, which are less consistent with her presentation as she appears to have a normal heart function aside from the slow rate, further favoring sinus bradycardia as the most likely diagnosis.",

In hemodynamically stable patients with a relative contraindication to \u03b2-blockers (COPD on home oxygen with increasing oxygen need), rate control with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil is preferred.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. ECG findings will be an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves with an erratic baseline as shown in Illustration A. Treatment is centered on rate control. First-line agents for rate control include \u03b21 selective blockers (metoprolol and esmolol) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem). In patients with COPD, non-selective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, timolol, and sotalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction by activating \u03b22-adrenoreceptors. Other relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers include Raynaud disease and depression (increased risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction). In patients with relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred initial treatment option.\n\nVan Gelder et al. studied lenient (resting heart rate < 110 beats per minute) versus strict rate control (resting heart rate < 80 beats per minute) in patients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized control trial. The authors found that there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmias between the 2 groups. The authors recommend a lenient rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG lacking P waves (red arrows) and irregularly irregular RR intervals (red/blue lines), which are classic findings in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic that can be used in patients to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is often suitable to use in patients with depressed left ventricular function. Amiodarone has multiple multi-system adverse effects including pulmonary toxicity, and it is not used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer B: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Although patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, the preferred anticoagulation agents are warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban).\n\nAnswer C: Digoxin can be used as a rate control agent in atrial fibrillation as it directly suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of toxicity, it is used as second-line therapy when first-line agents fail.\n\nAnswer D: Metoprolol is a \u03b2-blocker that is a first-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice.

The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

These symptoms are highly suggestive of a stroke, particularly an ischemic stroke given the sudden onset and focal neurological deficits.\n\n2. **Medical History**: The patient has a history of diabetes and atrial fibrillation, and he is taking warfarin. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of embolic strokes, and warfarin is an anticoagulant that could complicate the management of a stroke due to the risk of bleeding.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**: His vital signs show elevated blood pressure and a high pulse rate, which are common in acute stroke situations.\n\n4. **Immediate Concerns**: In the context of stroke, the immediate concern is to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. This differentiation is crucial because the treatment for ischemic stroke (such as thrombolysis with alteplase) is contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke due to the risk of worsening bleeding.\n\n5. **Next Step in Management**: The most appropriate next step is to perform a CT scan of the head. A CT scan is the fastest and most effective way to rule out hemorrhagic stroke, which is essential before considering thrombolytic therapy. It is also important to assess the extent of any ischemic changes.\n\n6. **Other Options**:\n   - **Alteplase**: This is a thrombolytic agent used in ischemic stroke but should not be administered until hemorrhagic stroke is ruled out.\n   - **Fingerstick Blood Glucose**: While checking blood glucose is important to rule out hypoglycemia as a cause of altered mental status, the priority in suspected stroke is imaging.\n   - **Fresh Frozen Plasma and Vitamin K**: These are used to reverse warfarin effects in case of bleeding, but imaging is needed first to confirm hemorrhage.\n   - **MRI Brain**: MRI provides detailed imaging but is not typically used in the acute setting due to time constraints; CT is preferred for rapid assessment.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n(B) CT head",

        "reason": "This patient with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, deviation of the tongue to the right, left-sided hemiparesis, and decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the left side of his body most likely has a stroke of the right medial medulla. The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome). This leads to lesions to the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Clinically this presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased gag reflex, vomiting, vertigo, decreased pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which presents with ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities, and contralateral loss of light touch and vibration sensation.",
        "raw_response": "To determine which artery is involved in this patient's presentation, we need to analyze the symptoms and understand the neuroanatomy related to these symptoms.\n\n1. **Symptoms Analysis:**\n   - **Difficulty speaking and eating:** This suggests possible involvement of cranial nerves or brain regions responsible for speech and swallowing.\n   - **Weakness on the left side:** Indicates a problem with the motor pathways affecting the left side of the body.\n   - **Tongue deviation to the right:** This suggests a lower motor neuron lesion affecting the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), which causes the tongue to deviate towards the side of the lesion.\n   - **Decreased sensation on the left side:** Indicates involvement of sensory pathways affecting the left side of the body.\n\n2. **Neuroanatomy Consideration:**\n   - The combination of tongue deviation to the right and left-sided weakness and sensory loss suggests a lesion affecting the right side of the medulla oblongata. This is because the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) originates in the medulla, and the motor and sensory pathways cross at this level.\n   - The anterior spinal artery supplies the medial part of the medulla, including the pyramids (motor pathways) and the medial lemniscus (sensory pathways), as well as the hypoglossal nucleus.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The symptoms are consistent with a medial medullary syndrome, which is typically caused by infarction due to occlusion of the anterior spinal artery.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with chest pain and an ECG demonstrating hyperacute T waves (leads V2-V6) which is an early finding concerning for a myocardial infarction.\n\nA myocardial infarction occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures causing occlusion of a coronary artery. Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI. The authors note that T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression can before, during, or after the STEMI event. The authors recommend obtaining serial ECGs in patients with suspected STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates hyperacute T waves (blue arrows) that are only occurring in a vascular distribution (V2-V6).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia can present with peaked T waves; however, peaked T waves would be demonstrated in all leads. Other findings of hyperkalemia can include QRS widening. Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias. Repletion with potassium is the preferred treatment, and the magnesium level should be checked as low magnesium can lead to potassium wasting in the kidneys.\n\nAnswer E: Pericarditis presents with chest pain worse by laying back and relieved by leaning forward. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions, and echocardiography may demonstrate a pericardial effusion. Management involves the administration of ibuprofen or colchicine and steroids in refractory cases. However, these therapies should not be used after myocardial infarction.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHyperacute T waves are an early finding that is concerning for myocardial infarction.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with chest pain that is dull, started 30 minutes ago, and worsens with exertion. He also experiences shortness of breath and fainting. Notably, the pain is worse when leaning back and improves when leaning forward.\n\n2. **Medical History**: The patient has diabetes and hypertension, managed with metformin and losartan.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**: The patient has a mild fever (99.2\u00b0F), normal blood pressure (130/87 mmHg), slightly elevated pulse (99/min), increased respirations (22/min), and normal oxygen saturation (100%).\n\n4. **Physical Exam**: The patient is overweight, with normal heart sounds (S1 and S2) and clear breath sounds.\n\n5. **ECG Findings**: While the ECG is not visible here, the description of symptoms and the context can guide us.\n\n6. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Hyperkalemia**: Typically presents with ECG changes such as peaked T waves, but the symptom description does not strongly suggest hyperkalemia.\n   - **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy**: Often presents with exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope, but the positional nature of the pain is not typical.\n   - **Hypokalemia**: Can cause muscle weakness and ECG changes, but the symptom description does not strongly suggest hypokalemia.\n   - **Myocardial Infarction**: Presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, but the positional nature of the pain (worse when leaning back, better when leaning forward) is not typical for myocardial infarction.\n   - **Pericarditis**: Characterized by chest pain that is relieved by leaning forward and worsened by leaning back, often accompanied by fever and sometimes fainting due to pain or discomfort.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The positional nature of the chest pain (worse when leaning back, improved when leaning forward) is highly suggestive of pericarditis. This, combined with the mild fever and the absence of other specific findings pointing to myocardial infarction or electrolyte imbalances, makes pericarditis the most likely diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n(E) Pericarditis",

Risk factors for this condition include the risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma such as consumption of alcohol and smoking. Though the cause of this lesion is largely idiopathic, any irritating substance can induce it. Other potential risk factors include candidiasis, vitamin deficiency, endocrine disturbances, and viral infections. A diagnosis can be made using a biopsy showing the degree of dysplasia. Treatment is with smoking and alcohol cessation as well as surgical removal for suspicious lesions.\n\nMohammed and Fairozekhan review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and risk factors for leukoplakia. They discuss how this disease is associated with smoking and alcohol use. They recommend screening patients for these modifiable risk factors.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating adherent white plaques on the inside of the cheek (red circle). These findings are consistent with oral leukoplakia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Antibiotic use is a risk factor for candidiasis; however, this patient is not presenting with symptoms of candidiasis which is itself a risk factor for oral leukoplakia. Candidiasis presents with opaque white lesions that can be scraped off.\n\nAnswer C: Intravenous drug use does make this patient riskier overall for many conditions; however, alcohol is a more direct risk factor for oral leukoplakia. Immunodeficiency conditions can cause widespread fungal and viral infections on the mucosal surfaces.\n\nAnswer D: Poor dental hygiene may be found more often in patients with oral leukoplakia; however, it is not itself a direct cause.\n\nAnswer E: Sexual intercourse would predispose this patient to infections and viruses (such as Epstein-Barr virus); however, it is a less likely risk factor than is alcohol consumption or smoking. These infections tend to present with ulcers more commonly than leukoplakia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRisk factors for oral leukoplakia and squamous cell carcinoma include alcohol consumption and smoking.",
        "raw_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's medical history, current medications, and the physical exam finding mentioned. The patient is on fluoxetine and lithium, which are used to treat depression. The physical exam finding in Figure A is not provided here, but we can infer that it is likely related to a common condition associated with the medications or lifestyle factors.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) Alcohol consumption: This can be a risk factor for various conditions, but without specific symptoms or findings, it's hard to directly link it to the patient's condition.\n\n(B) Antibiotic use: This is typically associated with conditions like antibiotic-associated diarrhea or resistance, but again, without specific symptoms or findings, it's not likely the most relevant risk factor.\n\n(C) Intravenous drug use: This is a risk factor for infections, particularly endocarditis, or conditions like hepatitis. If the physical exam finding is related to skin lesions or signs of infection, this could be relevant.\n\n(D) Poor dental hygiene: This is a risk factor for dental caries, gingivitis, and potentially endocarditis if there are oral infections. If the physical exam finding is related to oral health, this could be relevant.\n\n(E) Sexual intercourse: This is a risk factor for sexually transmitted infections. If the physical exam finding is related to genital lesions or signs of an STI, this could be relevant.\n\nGiven the medications (fluoxetine and lithium), one common physical finding associated with lithium use is acne or skin conditions. Poor dental hygiene is not directly related to lithium use, but it can be a risk factor for skin conditions if there is an infection that spreads.\n\nWithout the specific image or description of the physical exam finding, the most likely risk factor associated with a common condition seen in patients on lithium is poor dental hygiene, which can lead to infections that might manifest in skin conditions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely risk factor for this patient's presenting condition, considering the context, is:\n\n(D) Poor dental hygiene",
        "thinking": "The question requires an evaluation of the potential risk factors in relation to the patient's medications and the unspecified physical exam finding.

Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, management of viral meningitis consists of supportive care and monitoring for complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or SIADH.\n\nKohil et. al review viral meningitis.

It presents as acute onset, painless vision loss, normally in one eye. On fundoscopic exam, classic findings of this disease include venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool exudates, and edema/swelling of the optic disk can be seen. There is no definitive treatment for this disorder but symptomatic treatment includes intravitreal glucocorticoid injections and retinal laser photocoagulation. Retinal vein occlusion may resolve spontaneously or progress to permanent vision loss.\n\nRobinson and Halpern present evidence regarding the treatment of retinal vein occlusion.

Embolic sources may include carotid artery atherosclerosis or cardiac vegetation. Treatment is with risk factor control.\n\nAnswer B: Closed-angle glaucoma presents as sudden, painful, vision loss caused by increased intraocular pressure. The eye will appear red and often feel \u201chard.\u201d The optic disc will show characteristic cupping. Intraocular pressure will be levated and treatment is with acetazolamide, steroids, timolol, bromidine, and pilocarpine. Irodotomy is reserved for refractory cases.\n\nAnswer C: Papilledema may present as an enlargement in the blind spot and is usually bilateral, as it is caused by increased intracranial pressure. On fundoscopic exam, there will be bilateral optic disk swelling, seen as an elevated optic disk and blurred margins. Patients should undergo a neurologic evaluation to determine the etiology of the papilledema.\n\nAnswer D: Retinal detachment presents as monocular loss of vision, often described as a \u201ccurtain pulled down,\u201d and preceded by \u201cflashers\u201d and \u201cfloaters.\u201d On fundoscopic exam, crinkling of the retinal tissue and abrupt changes in vessel direction can be seen.

He has a high temperature (104\u00b0F), tachycardia (pulse 200/min), tachypnea (respirations 33/min), and dry mucous membranes with hot flushed skin. These signs are indicative of heat stroke, a condition that can occur after prolonged physical exertion in hot conditions.\n\n2. **Laboratory Values**: The lab results show:\n   - **Hypernatremia**: Serum Na+ is 165 mEq/L, which is significantly elevated.\n   - **Dehydration Indicators**: Elevated BUN (30 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.5 mg/dL) suggest dehydration.\n   - Other values are relatively normal, but the focus should be on the elevated sodium and signs of dehydration.\n\n3. **Pathophysiology**: The patient likely has exertional heat stroke, characterized by hyperthermia and dehydration. The hypernatremia indicates a significant water deficit relative to sodium, which is common in dehydration due to excessive sweating and inadequate fluid replacement.\n\n4. **Management Priorities**: The primary goals are to:\n   - Lower the body temperature.\n   - Correct the dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, particularly the hypernatremia.\n\n5. **Fluid Choice**: \n   - **Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl)**: Isotonic solution that can help with rehydration but may not be ideal for correcting hypernatremia.\n   - **Hypotonic Saline (e.g., 0.45% NaCl)**: More appropriate for correcting hypernatremia as it provides free water to help lower the sodium concentration.\n   - **Lactated Ringer**: Contains electrolytes similar to plasma but is not specifically designed to correct hypernatremia.\n   - **Dextrose Solutions**: Typically used for hypoglycemia or as a source of calories, not for correcting hypernatremia.\n   - **50% Normal Saline 50% Dextrose**: Not a standard treatment for hypernatremia or dehydration.\n\nGiven the patient's hypernatremia and dehydration, the most appropriate fluid choice to correct the electrolyte imbalance and provide free water is hypotonic saline.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**(C) Hypotonic saline**",

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin.

Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data. The authors found that sickle cell trait is associated with increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy.

Mechanisms include functional asplenism, reduced tissue perfusion during a sickle crisis, and chronic transfusions with an indwelling catheter. Common infections include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitis. Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism. Most individuals with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic by age 2 to 4. The spleen subsequently cannot phagocytose encapsulated organisms properly, which predisposes sickle cell patients to infection.\n\nAnswer E: Stroke is a complication of sickle cell anemia but not sickle cell trait. This is due to the increased viscosity of the blood and reduced deformability of red cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSickle cell trait is associated with episodes of painless hematuria.",

His temperature is 98.0\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a young man who is vomiting. His gait is ataxic and he exhibits rightward nystagmus. His dizziness is constant and unchanged with performance of the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The head impulse test reveals a corrective saccade and there is no skew deviation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient is presenting with constant vertigo, ataxia, vomiting, and a head impulse test revealing a corrective saccade, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) exam, which suggests a peripheral etiology of vertigo, most likely vestibular neuritis. As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient\u2019s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.",

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

The lungs are clear, which suggests no immediate respiratory distress. The key finding is the dipstick urinalysis showing 4+ blood and dark-colored urine.\n\n3. **Urinalysis Interpretation**: The presence of 4+ blood in the urine without red blood cells suggests myoglobinuria, which is often due to rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can occur after prolonged immobility, trauma, or other causes leading to muscle breakdown.\n\n4. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Although the ECG is not shown here, the context suggests that it might show changes related to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, which is common in rhabdomyolysis due to the release of intracellular potassium.\n\n5. **Management of Rhabdomyolysis**: The primary concern in rhabdomyolysis is preventing acute kidney injury due to myoglobinuria and managing electrolyte imbalances, especially hyperkalemia.\n\n6. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation: Albuterol can help lower potassium levels, but the primary treatment for rhabdomyolysis is aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to prevent kidney damage.\n   - (B) Calcium gluconate: Used to stabilize cardiac membranes in severe hyperkalemia, but not the first step unless ECG changes are life-threatening.\n   - (C) Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation: Insulin and glucose can help shift potassium intracellularly, but the immediate need is fluid resuscitation.\n   - (D) IV fluid resuscitation: This is the cornerstone of rhabdomyolysis management to prevent acute kidney injury.\n   - (E) Sodium polystyrene sulfonate: Used to remove potassium from the body, but not the immediate first step in rhabdomyolysis.\n\nGiven the presentation and the need to prevent kidney damage from myoglobinuria, the most appropriate next step is:\n\n(D) IV fluid resuscitation",

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs in almost all patients with MEN2B and is often metastatic at the time of diagnosis. Patients should be screened for pheochromocytoma using plasma fractionated metanephrines at the time of diagnosis of MTC. Intestinal neuromas may also lead to intestinal manifestations such as chronic constipation and megacolon. Treatment is with surgical excision of malignant lesions and active screening for future development of tumors.\n\nCastinetti et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of MEN2B. They discuss how often the first presentation of this disease involves the diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma. They recommend developing techniques for earlier diagnosis of this disease in order to allow for better survival.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating mucosal neuromas, which are painless nodules on the lips or tongue (red circles). These findings are characteristically seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: An elevated serum calcium level would suggest parathyroid hyperplasia, which is a feature of both type 1 and type 2A multiple endocrine neoplasia. Rather than hypercalcemia, this patient is likely to have an elevated serum calcitonin level due to his medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nAnswer C: An elevated serum prolactin level would suggest the presence of a prolactinoma, which is a pituitary tumor that may be seen in type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1). Other findings in this disorder include parathyroid and pancreatic tumors. Treatment is with surgical excision of malignant lesions.\n\nAnswer D: Fasting hypoglycemia would suggest the presence of an insulinoma, which is a less common pancreatic tumor that may be seen in MEN1.

These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction. They discuss how an ACE inhibitor is the standard of care in patients currently. They recommend performing a randomized controlled trial comparing these treatment modalities.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an ECG with ST elevation (red circles) in leads II, III, and AVF. These ST elevations are indicative of a STEMI.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hydrochlorothiazide can be used to manage this patient's blood pressure; however, this drug does not lower mortality like an ACE inhibitor. In the setting of patients with myocardial infarctions, inhibition of detrimental ventricular remodeling is key for lowering mortality.\n\nAnswer C: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to reduce blood pressure; however, it does not reduce mortality in patients who have experienced an MI. Calcium channel blockers tend to have few side effects and can be safely started in most patients.\n\nAnswer D: Continuing current medications and scheduling a follow-up appointment misses the opportunity for the patient to be started on a mortality-lowering ACE inhibitor. In patients who are amenable to starting a new medication, an ACE inhibitor should be administered to all patients who have sustained an MI.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to carvedilol would be unnecessary and not likely to benefit this patient as much as adding an ACE inhibitor. Metoprolol is the preferred beta blocker in patients who have sustained an MI.

Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased. It would not present with the abnormal neurologic findings seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRoux-en-Y bariatric surgery increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency via reduction of food intake, decreased functional parietal cell count, and reduced absorption of vitamin B12 (which may cause subacute combined degeneration).",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with mood changes, recent falls, irritability, anhedonia (loss of pleasure in activities), reduced sleep, and weakness in the lower extremities with brisk reflexes. These symptoms suggest a neurological issue, possibly affecting both mood and motor function.\n\n2. **Medical History**: She has generalized anxiety disorder and hypothyroidism, treated with escitalopram (an SSRI) and levothyroxine. She also had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 5 years ago, which is significant for potential malabsorption issues.\n\n3. **Physical Examination**: Notable findings include depressed affect, 4/5 strength in the lower extremities, and brisk patellar reflexes. These could indicate a neurological deficit, possibly related to vitamin deficiencies.\n\n4. **Potential Causes**:\n   - **(A) Poor iron absorption**: Iron deficiency typically causes anemia, which can lead to fatigue and weakness, but not the specific neurological symptoms described.\n   - **(B) Prior Treponema pallidum exposure**: This refers to syphilis, which can cause neurological symptoms in its tertiary stage (neurosyphilis), but the patient's monogamous relationship and lack of other symptoms make this less likely.\n   - **(C) Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin**: This could explain mood changes and irritability, but not the neurological symptoms like falls and weakness.\n   - **(D) Reduced functional parietal cell count**: This would lead to vitamin B12 deficiency due to lack of intrinsic factor, common after gastric bypass surgery. B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms (e.g., weakness, brisk reflexes, mood changes).\n   - **(E) Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose**: Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue and mood changes, but the neurological symptoms are less typical.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The combination of mood changes, neurological symptoms, and history of gastric bypass surgery strongly suggests vitamin B12 deficiency due to malabsorption. This is consistent with reduced functional parietal cell count leading to decreased intrinsic factor production and subsequent B12 deficiency.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:\n\n**(D) Reduced functional parietal cell count**",
        "thinking": "The patient's symptoms of mood changes, weakness, and brisk reflexes, along with a history of gastric bypass suggesting possible malabsorption, point towards a deficiency in vitamin B12 due to reduced function of parietal cells which produce intrinsic factor necessary for B12 absorption.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a pattern of chest pain (pressure and diaphoresis) that is highly concerning for an acute myocardial infarction. This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome. They recommend aspirin and catheterization in an acute STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an initial ECG with ST depression (blue arrows) followed by pseudonormalization of the ST segment (green arrows) and possibly hyperacute T waves (black arrows), which are concerning for ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac catheterization may be required in this patient; however, if the patient\u2019s chest pain improves or if the troponin is negative, it is unlikely he is having an acute myocardial infarction requiring immediate catheterization. Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.",

His symptoms started while lifting boxes, suggesting exertion-related onset, which is typical for cardiac issues.\n\n2. **Risk Factors**: The patient has several risk factors for coronary artery disease, including diabetes, obesity, and a significant smoking history (1 pack per day for 30 years).\n\n3. **Vital Signs and Physical Exam**: The patient is hypertensive (BP 155/99 mmHg), tachycardic (pulse 110/min), and tachypneic (respirations 22/min), which are consistent with distress possibly due to cardiac ischemia. He is diaphoretic and uncomfortable, further supporting the likelihood of ACS.\n\n4. **Initial Management**: He has been given aspirin, which is standard initial treatment for suspected ACS. An ECG has been performed, and a repeat ECG shows worsening chest pain, indicating possible progression of ischemia.\n\n5. **Nitroglycerin Administration**: He was given nitroglycerin with minimal improvement, suggesting significant coronary artery blockage.\n\n6. **Troponin Level**: A troponin level is drawn, which is important for diagnosing myocardial infarction, but results may take time.\n\n7. **Next Step in Management**: Given the clinical picture of ACS with worsening symptoms and minimal response to nitroglycerin, the most appropriate next step is to proceed with cardiac catheterization. This is an urgent intervention to assess and potentially treat coronary artery blockages, especially in the context of a suspected myocardial infarction.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n(A) Cardiac catheterization\n\nThis choice is based on the need for urgent intervention in the setting of suspected acute myocardial infarction with ongoing chest pain and significant risk factors.",

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent. However, it is highly effective in patients who have failed other first-line agents and should still be used in appropriate candidates.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSNRIs are appropriate first-line agents for major depressive disorder in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

These symptoms have been present for 4 months following the death of his wife, suggesting a major depressive disorder rather than just normal grief.\n\n2. **Physical Health Symptoms**: The patient has burning and electric pain in his legs, which is likely neuropathic pain due to his history of poorly controlled diabetes and peripheral vascular disease. The reduced sensation and electric pain upon touch are typical of diabetic neuropathy.\n\n3. **Medication Options**:\n   - **Amitriptyline**: A tricyclic antidepressant that can treat both depression and neuropathic pain. However, it has anticholinergic side effects and can be risky in older adults, especially with cardiovascular issues.\n   - **Bupropion**: An antidepressant that is effective for depression but not typically used for neuropathic pain.\n   - **Escitalopram**: A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) effective for depression but not for neuropathic pain.\n   - **Phenelzine**: A monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) used for depression but not for neuropathic pain and has dietary restrictions and side effects.\n   - **Venlafaxine**: A serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that can treat both depression and neuropathic pain.\n\n4. **Best Choice**: Given the patient's symptoms of depression and neuropathic pain, Venlafaxine (E) is the most appropriate choice.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).",

He has tachycardia (pulse 167/min) and tachypnea (respirations 29/min). Oxygen saturation is normal at 99%.\n\n3. **Urine Dipstick**: The urine dipstick is positive for red blood cells, which suggests possible rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can occur due to extreme physical exertion, especially in hot conditions, leading to muscle breakdown.\n\n4. **Potential Complications**: Rhabdomyolysis can lead to several metabolic disturbances:\n   - **Hyperkalemia**: Due to the release of potassium from damaged muscle cells.\n   - **Hyperphosphatemia**: Due to the release of phosphate from muscle cells.\n   - **Hyperuricemia**: Due to increased purine metabolism.\n   - **Hypocalcemia**: Initially, calcium may bind to damaged muscle tissue.\n   - **Hyponatremia**: Can occur due to fluid shifts or excessive sweating.\n\n5. **Most Likely Laboratory Finding**: In the context of rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia is a common and significant finding due to the release of intracellular potassium from damaged muscle cells. This is a critical condition that needs to be monitored and managed due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient, given the scenario of rhabdomyolysis, is:\n\n(A) Hyperkalemia\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'A'.",

A common paraneoplastic syndrome in small cell lung cancer is Lambert-Eaton syndrome which presents with muscle weakness that improves with activity and worsens with rest. Activity improves symptoms due to accumulation of calcium with exercise which allows for acetylcholine release. This occurs secondary to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels which decrease acetylcholine release. The diagnosis of Lambert Eaton syndrome can be confirmed with electromyography.

A glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells.\n\nA glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas. This tumor pathologically secretes glucagon leading to profound hyperglycemia that is refractory to the normal treatments for diabetes. Patients also present with a classic rash termed necrolytic migratory erythema which presents with painful, erythematous papules and plaques. Other findings include gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hematologic findings include a normocytic, normochromic anemia. The diagnosis can be supported with a glucagon level, which will be elevated. Imaging of the pancreas by CT or MRI (more accurate) can further support the diagnosis.\n\nZandee et al. review glucagonoma. They note the presentation and symptoms associated with a glucagonoma, including the classic rash and elevated blood glucose. They recommend considering this diagnosis in patients who present with rash and hyperglycemia refractory to typical treatments.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Beta-cell destruction is the pathophysiology of type I diabetes mellitus which presents with polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, and hyperglycemia (typically in a pediatric patient). It can progress to diabetic ketoacidosis which presents with hyperglycemia, an anion gap acidosis, altered mental status, and Kussmaul respirations.\n\nAnswer C: Beta-cell tumor describes an insulinoma, which would present with hypoglycemia refractory to glucose administration. This condition is caused by increased release of insulin. The diagnosis should be suspected in the setting of hypoglycemia, an elevated insulin level, and an elevated C-peptide level. Imaging of the abdomen/pancreas with an MRI will reveal the insulin-secreting mass.\n\nAnswer D: Hypercortisolism can cause Cushing syndrome which presents with hyperglycemia, obesity, striae, limb/muscle atrophy, mood changes, and hypertension. A buffalo hump and moon faces may also be seen. This condition can either be from endogenous ACTH production or cortisol production or can be from exogenous steroid use.\n\nAnswer E: Insulin resistance is the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and presents with obesity, hyperglycemia, and an elevated hemoglobin A1c.

They are sometimes still used for depression and neuropathic pain. In overdose, TCAs block sodium channels in the heart and cause a pathognomonic QRS widening. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered until the QRS duration normalizes. TCAs also have anticholinergic properties and can cause an anticholinergic toxidrome including delirium, confusion, constipation, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, dry, warm, and flushed skin, and fever. Although physostigmine is typically the antidote of choice for an anticholinergic toxidrome, it is avoided in TCA toxicity due to the theoretical concern for inducing a cardiac arrest.\n\nUrquhart et al. studied the utility of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of chronic lower back pain.

Rather, dry, flushed skin would be seen in an anticholinergic toxidrome.\n\nAnswer B: Jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain would be seen in acetaminophen overdose which can cause fulminant liver failure. It is also possible that patients may initially be asymptomatic in acetaminophen overdose, and a high level of suspicion must be maintained for this diagnosis.

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial.

The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration).

Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies.

They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery. They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation. It would be inappropriate to only treat this patient symptomatically with a lateral anal fissure as this is a sign of a more serious diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnal fissures that are lateral to the midline require workup for sexually transmitted infections, cancer, and autoimmune disease.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections. Corticosteroid use is part of symptom management as it decreases the inflammatory response.\n\nBullet Summary:\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can result in worsening of infectious symptoms and is managed by continuing antiviral therapy with symptomatic treatment.",

He had a very low CD4 count (40/mm^3) and a high HIV viral load (115,000 copies/mL) about 5 weeks ago, indicating advanced HIV infection.\n\n2. **Initial Treatment**: He was treated appropriately, likely with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and possibly antibiotics or anti-tuberculous therapy, given the lung infiltrate and low CD4 count. After 4 weeks of treatment, his CD4 count improved significantly to over 400/mm^3, and his viral load became negligible, indicating a good response to ART.\n\n3. **Current Presentation**: He now presents with fever, cough, and hemoptysis again, with new nodules in the left upper lobe and hilar adenopathy on chest radiograph. These findings suggest a possible opportunistic infection or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).\n\n4. **IRIS Consideration**: IRIS can occur in patients with HIV who start ART and experience rapid immune recovery, leading to an inflammatory response against existing infections. The new nodules and adenopathy could be indicative of IRIS, especially given the rapid increase in CD4 count.\n\n5. **Management Options**:\n   - **(A) Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies**: This option suggests maintaining the current treatment regimen, which might be appropriate if the patient is stable and the current therapies are addressing the underlying infections.\n   - **(B) Determine drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection**: This option is more relevant if there is suspicion of drug-resistant infection, but the scenario suggests IRIS rather than drug resistance.\n   - **(C) Discontinue antimicrobial treatment**: Discontinuing antimicrobials could be harmful if there is an ongoing infection.\n   - **(D) Obtain a D-dimer level**: This is typically used to assess for thromboembolic events, which are not indicated by the current symptoms and findings.\n   - **(E) Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy**: High-dose glucocorticoids are used to manage IRIS, but discontinuing ART is generally not recommended unless the IRIS is life-threatening.\n\n6. **Most Appropriate Next Step**: Given the likelihood of IRIS due to the rapid immune recovery and new pulmonary findings, starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment to manage the inflammatory response is appropriate. However, discontinuing ART is not typically recommended unless absolutely necessary.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**(E) Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy**.",

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.",

He wakes up screaming in pain due to an electrocardiogram lead having caused a significant thermal burn circumferentially around his left leg. He is admitted to the medical intensive care unit for continuous electroencephalogram monitoring while on a midazolam infusion for seizure suppression and supportive care for his burn. Overnight, the nurse continued to increase the patient's midazolam infusion rate, but she also noticed that his left toes were cold to the touch with significant edema. His temperature is now 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 10/min and oxygen saturation is 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

The most appropriate next step in management is emergent escharotomy to restore blood flow.\n\nBurns can be caused by chemical, thermal, electrical, and radiation sources. The initial inflammation causes vasodilatation and hyperemia, which can progress to edema and local microvascular thrombosis. If not promptly addressed, tissue necrosis and irreversible damage can occur. Circumferential burns can evolve into eschars that constrict blood flow and cause distal compartment syndrome. A delta pressure (diastolic pressure minus local compartment pressure) lower than 30 mmHg is diagnostic. In the case of eschar-induced compartment syndrome, the most appropriate next step is escharotomy to alleviate pressure.\n\nOrmiston and Marappa-Ganeshan review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with compartment syndrome. They discuss how this condition can be caused by many different pathologies including burns. They recommend the emergent release of constrictive structures.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amputation may be necessary if the distal limb is completely necrotic and not salvageable. Timely release of the eschar can allow for reperfusion of the limb and prevent this outcome.\n\nAnswer C: Fasciotomy is the treatment of choice for compartment syndrome not due to a circumferential eschar, but in this case the least invasive surgical intervention should be performed first without releasing all the compartments of the lower leg. If escharotomy does not relieve the compartment syndrome then fasciotomy may be required.\n\nAnswer D: Intravenous fluid infusion based on the Parkland formula is part of comprehensive burn management, but would not address the underlying compartment syndrome, which is more urgent at this time.\n\nAnswer E: Transfer to a specialized burn center can be considered since circumferential burns are one of the admission criteria, but early escharotomy should be performed first.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCircumferential burns that cause eschars and compartment syndrome require an escharotomy.",

He is currently in the medical intensive care unit.\n\n2. **Current Symptoms and Findings**:\n   - The patient is on a midazolam infusion for seizure suppression.\n   - His left toes are cold to the touch with significant edema.\n   - No dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses are detected on the left lower extremity.\n   - A delta pressure of 25 mmHg is obtained in the left leg.\n   - Vital signs: Temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 10/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\n\n3. **Clinical Interpretation**:\n   - The absence of pulses and cold toes suggest compromised blood flow to the left leg.\n   - Significant edema and a delta pressure of 25 mmHg indicate possible compartment syndrome. Delta pressure is calculated as diastolic blood pressure minus intracompartmental pressure. A delta pressure less than 30 mmHg is concerning for compartment syndrome.\n\n4. **Management Options**:\n   - **Amputation (A)**: This is a drastic measure and typically not the first step unless the limb is non-viable and other interventions have failed.\n   - **Escharotomy (B)**: This procedure is performed to relieve pressure from circumferential burns that can restrict blood flow and lead to compartment syndrome.\n   - **Fasciotomy (C)**: This is performed to relieve compartment syndrome by cutting the fascia to relieve pressure. Given the delta pressure and symptoms, this is a strong consideration.\n   - **Intravenous fluid infusion based on Parkland formula (D)**: This is used for fluid resuscitation in burn patients but does not address the acute issue of compartment syndrome.\n   - **Transfer to burn center (E)**: While beneficial for specialized care, it does not immediately address the acute compartment syndrome.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The patient exhibits signs of compartment syndrome in the left leg, indicated by the cold toes, absence of pulses, significant edema, and a delta pressure of 25 mmHg.\n   - The most appropriate immediate intervention to relieve pressure and restore circulation is a fasciotomy.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\n**(C) Fasciotomy**",

Patients are often asymptomatic and may present with a white blood cell count > 50,000/mm^3. There are many different presentations. The chronic phase presents with < 10% blasts and is often asymptomatic. The accelerated phase has increased blasts, and patients present with fatigue, weight loss, malaise, night sweats, abdominal pain, and hepatosplenomegaly. Finally, the blast phase presents similar to the accelerated phase but with more severe symptoms. The blast phase may evolve into a blast crisis (> 20% blasts) which could cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. Hypervicosity syndrome may require IV fluids and leukapheresis. The most common translocation in CML is the 9;22 translocation which forms the BCR:ABL gene product.\n\nJain et al. review CML. They note the outcomes in patients in the blast phase in CML and how there are more poor outcomes associated with this phase.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with constant right upper quadrant pain in the setting of oral contraceptives (OCP) and likely anabolic steroid use, suggesting a diagnosis of a ruptured hepatic adenoma (HA). The pathophysiology of HA is vascular ectasia from exposure to OCPs and androgens.\n\nA hepatic adenoma typically occurs secondary to exposure to OCPs and androgens (anabolic steroids) causing a generalized vascular ectasia. Both of these drugs should be discontinued in patients with hepatic adenoma. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Sudden worsening of pain with unstable vitals suggests a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Patients should be managed with fluids and an ultrasound should be performed to support the diagnosis. Additional imaging tests include an abdominal contrast-enhanced CT to better characterize the pathologic anatomy in this disease. The definitive treatment in this disease is surgery in order to remove the hepatic adenoma. In cases of a ruptured hepatic adenomas, patients require transfusion and operative management.\n\nBioulac-Sage et al. present the current data that are available for classifying hepatic adenomas. They discuss how many of these lesions involve alterations of the HNF1A gene, the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and the CTNNB1 gene. They recommend performing molecular analysis in order to better understand which lesions are likely to undergo malignant transformation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ectopic implantation of a blastocyst (ectopic pregnancy) that has ruptured could present similarly to what this patient is experiencing. Symptoms would include lower abdominal pain and unstable vitals. However, this patient's pain is more pronounced in the right upper quadrant and is occurring in the setting of OCP and possible anabolic steroid use.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation of the pancreas represents a diagnosis of pancreatitis. This would present with epigastric pain after a fatty meal or alcohol consumption. Though this patient does drink more than recommended and should be counseled to reduce her consumption, the pain began after exercising at the gym and there are no other symptoms of pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer C: Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein causes Budd-Chiari syndrome, which presents with a non-specific triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly in the setting of a hypercoagulable state (factor V Leiden, polycythemia vera, OCP use, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). Though this patient has risk factors for this pathology, they do not have any classic symptoms.\n\nAnswer D: Obstruction of the common bile duct with radio-opaque stones would present with colicky right upper quadrant pain in a patient that is \"fat, female, fertile, and forty.\" Though the pain presented in this case is localized to the right upper quadrant, it is not colicky and there is not a positive Murphy sign described. OCP's are a risk factor for cholesterol stones as are rapid weight loss, both of which this patient has. This is a strong possibility on the differential; however, the symptoms presented suggest a diagnosis of ruptured hepatic adenoma given the demographics of the patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA hepatic adenoma presents with right upper quadrant pain in the setting of OCP and/or androgen use and can rupture leading to unstable vitals.",

However, the severe right upper quadrant pain and the physical exam findings do not strongly suggest an ectopic pregnancy, which typically presents with lower abdominal pain.\n   - **Pancreatitis (Option B)**: Inflammation of the pancreas could cause abdominal pain, but the pain is usually in the epigastric region and radiates to the back. The right upper quadrant focus and the patient's history do not strongly suggest pancreatitis.\n   - **Budd-Chiari Syndrome (Option C)**: Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein can cause right upper quadrant pain, ascites, and liver dysfunction. The patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia could be consistent with shock due to liver dysfunction. The physical exam findings of an athletic build and acne could suggest anabolic steroid use, which is a risk factor for Budd-Chiari syndrome.\n   - **Cholelithiasis/Cholecystitis (Option D)**: Obstruction of the common bile duct by stones can cause right upper quadrant pain, but the sudden worsening during exercise and the physical exam findings do not strongly suggest this diagnosis.\n   - **Vascular Ectasia (Option E)**: This is less likely to cause acute severe pain and the specific symptoms described.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The combination of right upper quadrant pain, low blood pressure, tachycardia, and the physical exam findings suggest Budd-Chiari syndrome. The patient's athletic build and acne could indicate anabolic steroid use, which is a risk factor for hepatic vein obstruction.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n(C) Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein",

Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children. The authors find that there was no difference in complications or outcomes between nail bed repair and trephination; however, the cost in the nail trephination group was lower.

A spontaneous subungual hematoma could be suggestive of melanoma; however, in the setting of trauma, it is a much less likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer B: Fingernail removal should only be performed if there is also nail avulsion or nail fold disruption to allow for inspection of the nail bed and repair of any laceration. Failure to repair a nailbed laceration could lead to permanent deformity of the fingernail when it regrows.\n\nAnswer C: Observation is inappropriate as the accumulation of blood under the nail in a subungual hematoma could lead to ischemia and permanent injury to the nailbed. When a subungual hematoma is present, trephination is indicated.\n\nAnswer D: Operative repair may be necessary for fractures; however, this patient has no fracture and only has a subungual hematoma which can be drained easily.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA subungual hematoma is common after trauma, presents with a collection of blood under the fingernail, and should be treated with trephination.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with urticaria whenever she engages in sexual intercourse suggesting a latex allergy (found in condoms). These allergies are due to antigen exposure.\n\nAnaphylaxis and urticaria are immunologically mediated responses to environmental antigens that are typically IgE-mediated. This results in crosslinking of antigen receptors and the subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory signals. Patients can present with a spectrum of symptoms from urticaria (hives alone) all the way to full-blown anaphylaxis (hypotension, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction). Minor cases can be treated with avoidance of antigen exposure. Anaphylaxis is treated with intramuscular epinephrine (1:1,000).\n\nGawchik reviewed the evidence regarding the diagnosis of latex allergy. She discusses how the diagnosis is primarily made by observing the relationship between exposure and symptoms. She recommends avoidance of latex in these patients.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph that demonstrates dermal edema and urticaria (red circles). This can occur secondary to allergen exposure such as from a new drug or latex.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Drug reaction could be possible if this patient has an antibiotic allergy (ceftriaxone is a treatment for gonorrhea); however, a rash that only occurs during intercourse is more likely related to latex exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is possible given this patient\u2019s IV drug abuse and risky behavior; however, the hives present in this patient are likely not related to an infection. Infectious rashes tend to be painful, ulcerative, or vesicular.\n\nAnswer D: IV drug use could expose this patient to any number of foreign substances that could induce an allergic reaction; however, the symptoms that are associated with sexual intercourse point toward latex exposure.\n\nAnswer E: Photosensitivity would not present as hives but could occur in this patient given that doxycycline is an appropriate drug to treat her initial sexually transmitted infection and offers coverage for Chlamydia trachomatis. Patients would present with a photosensitive rash.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnaphylaxis and urticaria can occur secondary to latex exposure (such as from condoms or gloves).",

She has engaged in unprotected intercourse with multiple partners and consumes alcohol regularly.\n\n2. **Initial Presentation**: She presented with abnormal vaginal discharge, which could be indicative of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). She was given antibiotics and advised on safe sex practices.\n\n3. **Subsequent Symptoms**: Three days after starting antibiotics, she developed a rash. She reports that the rash appears every time she has sex. Her vital signs are mostly normal, with a slight fever (99.5\u00b0F).\n\n4. **Physical Exam**: The rash is a notable finding, but without seeing Figure A, we must rely on the description that it appears after sexual activity.\n\n5. **Potential Causes**:\n   - **Antigen exposure (A)**: This could be related to an allergic reaction to something encountered during sexual activity, but the timing with antibiotic use suggests otherwise.\n   - **Drug reaction (B)**: The rash developed after starting antibiotics, which is a common timeframe for drug reactions. Antibiotics are known to cause allergic reactions or drug-induced rashes.\n   - **Infection (C)**: While infections can cause rashes, the timing with antibiotic use and the fact that the rash appears after sex suggests a different cause.\n   - **IV drug use (D)**: While IV drug use can lead to skin issues, the rash's timing with antibiotic use and sexual activity suggests a different cause.\n   - **Photosensitivity (E)**: Photosensitivity reactions are typically related to sun exposure, not sexual activity.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the timing of the rash's appearance after starting antibiotics and the commonality of drug reactions causing rashes, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a drug reaction.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:\n\n(B) Drug reaction",

The most appropriate next step is to repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir.\n\nHealthcare exposures to HIV are divided into 2 categories based on the level of contact with the source patient. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, immediate prophylaxis is recommended. This category also includes all needlestick exposures. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects. Prophylactic treatment should be initiated immediately (ideally within 1-2 hours) and continued for 4 weeks at which time the healthcare worker\u2019s serology should be repeated.\n\nParikh et al. studied technologies for monitoring HIV infection. They discuss how high throughput methods are required in order to surveil for infection on a population level. They recommend using next-generation sequencing methods to improve surveillance methods.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Immediately initiating triple antiretroviral therapy is appropriate after drawing the medical student\u2019s HIV serology. The patient\u2019s serology at the time of exposure must be established to compare to future testing. Despite her previous negative serology and low-risk lifestyle, it would still be best to repeat the testing at the same time prophylactic treatment is initiated.\n\nAnswer B: Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results is incorrect because this option would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Empiric treatment with a triple antiretroviral drug combination is appropriate for all patients with high-risk exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Waiting to hear that the medical student\u2019s HIV serology is negative would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Triple antiretroviral drug treatment should be initiated without waiting for the results. Empiric treatment of all patients with high-risk exposure is recommended in all cases.\n\nAnswer D: Waiting for the results of the medical student\u2019s serology would delay treatment for her exposure. If her serology is already positive, she will need to be treated past the 4-week period of prophylaxis. Even though she does not engage in high-risk behaviors, a positive serology would demonstrate that she was already infected with HIV.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAfter a needlestick injury from a HIV-positive source patient, a healthcare worker\u2019s HIV serology should be drawn and they should be immediately initiated on triple antiretroviral drug therapy.",
        "raw_response": "To determine the most appropriate next step in management for the medical student who sustained a needlestick injury from an HIV-positive patient, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Risk of Transmission**: Needlestick injuries involving HIV-positive patients pose a risk of transmission, especially when the source patient has a high viral load. In this case, the source patient has a viral load of 1,800,000 copies/mL, which is quite high, increasing the risk of transmission.\n\n2. **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**: The standard of care for healthcare workers who have been exposed to HIV through needlestick injuries is to initiate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible, ideally within hours of exposure. PEP typically involves a combination of antiretroviral drugs (usually a triple therapy regimen) to reduce the risk of seroconversion.\n\n3. **Timing**: The effectiveness of PEP is highest when started immediately after exposure. Delaying PEP to wait for HIV serology results is not recommended because it could reduce the effectiveness of the prophylaxis.\n\n4. **Current Guidelines**: Current guidelines recommend initiating PEP immediately after a high-risk exposure, without waiting for serology results, as the goal is to prevent the establishment of infection.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate next step is to initiate triple antiretroviral therapy immediately to provide the best chance of preventing HIV transmission.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy",

Emergency laparoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy, due to implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube, can be life-threatening if it ruptures leading to intra-abdominal hemorrhage and shock. Initial laboratory studies should include a complete blood count and a pregnancy test. A patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability should be ascertained immediately as it determines the most appropriate next step in management. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable (hypotensive and tachycardic), a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam should be immediately performed to evaluate for intraperitoneal bleeding, and ob/gyn should be immediately consulted for emergent surgical intervention (e.g., salpingectomy or salpingotomy).

Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers. They found that about many had confirmed infections. They recommend against empiric treatment without prior confirmation of infection.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Crypt abscesses are found on histology in ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients can also experience musculoskeletal pain, uveitis, and dermatologic findings such as erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum.

Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, management of viral meningitis consists of supportive care and monitoring for complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or SIADH.\n\nKohil et. al review viral meningitis.

The most appropriate treatment for these conditions is valproic acid.\n\nAbsence seizures classically present with cessation of motor activity and speech with a blank facial expression and occasionally automatisms such as flickering of the eyelids. They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer. It carries the potentially severe side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is not a first-line treatment for absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Stevens-Johnson syndrome will present with painful desquamation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAbsence seizures present with periods of inattentiveness and subtle automatisms and are most appropriately treated with ethosuximide or with valproic acid if there is concurrent juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

The thymus is visible on a chest radiograph in infants and continues to grow throughout childhood. It is located in the anterior part of the superior mediastinum. On a chest radiograph, the thymus may appear as a \u201cwidened mediastinum,\u201d continuous with the superior border of the heart (Figure A) or as a triangular-shaped opacity known as the thymic \u201csail sign,\" located towards the right of the mediastinum.

In response to respiratory infections, certain structures in the chest may change or react.\n\n2. **Structures in the Chest**:\n   - **A**: This could represent the trachea or bronchi, which are airways that can become inflamed or obstructed during respiratory infections.\n   - **B**: This might be the heart, which generally does not change in response to respiratory infections.\n   - **C**: This could be the lungs themselves, which are directly affected by pneumonia. They can show changes such as consolidation or infiltrates on radiographs.\n   - **D**: This might represent the diaphragm, which typically does not change in response to infections.\n   - **E**: This could be lymph nodes, which are part of the immune system and can enlarge in response to infections.\n\n3. **Most Likely Structure to Change**: In the context of another infectious illness, particularly a respiratory one, the lungs (C) are the most likely to show changes. Pneumonia directly affects the lung tissue, causing changes visible on radiographs such as infiltrates or consolidation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the scenario of a respiratory infection like pneumonia, the lungs are the structure most likely to change in response to another infectious illness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **C**.",

It is more common in young patients who are active (e.g. marathon runners). The classic conventional radiographic finding in cecal volvulus is the coffee bean sign, in which closed loops of intestine distend with gas, making visible the medial and lateral walls of dilated bowel. Diagnosis of cecal volvulus can be confirmed with a CT scan. Management involves analgesia, intravenous fluids, and surgical detorsion.\n\nHasbahceci et al. review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of cecal volvulus. The authors find that abdominal radiography has a low sensitivity for cecal volvulus. The authors recommend surgical management of cecal volvulus with resection with right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a radiograph demonstrating the \"coffee bean\" sign which is suggestive of a cecal volvulus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ileus presents after surgery or manipulation of the intestines with decreased peristalsis of the intestine leading to a failure to pass gas or have bowel movements. Treatment involves treating any electrolyte abnormalities, encouraging ambulation, and avoiding medications that decrease peristalsis (such as opioids).\n\nAnswer C: Ogilvie syndrome occurs when the colon wall is not appropriately undergoing peristalsis leading to a dilated colon with abdominal distension. It is more common in the elderly and critically ill patients. Treatment involves the placement of a rectal tube to decompress the intestines and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Sigmoid volvulus is more common in elderly and critically ill patients and presents with constipation, an absence of bowel movements, and a distended, tympanitic abdomen. Although the coffee bean sign may also be seen in patients with sigmoid volvulus, patients tend to be older. In addition, plain radiography typically demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels in a sigmoid volvulus versus usually only a single air-fluid level in a cecal volvulus. Treatment involves flexible sigmoidoscopy and surgery.\n\nAnswer E: Small bowel obstruction presents with a distended and tympanitic abdomen with nausea, vomiting, and an absence of flatus or bowel movements. Radiography may demonstrate distended bowel and air-fluid levels, and the most accurate test is a CT scan of the abdomen. It occurs secondary to adhesions entrapping the bowel.

The increased PTH results in renal phosphate wasting, increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and increased renal calcium reabsorption.

This patient does not have metabolic alkalosis. Treatment is with the discontinuation of the offending agent.\n\nAnswer B: Increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D occurs in sarcoidosis which presents with cough, fatigue, and weight loss in an African American woman. Increased vitamin D by itself will result in hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia rather than hypophosphatemia.

Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.",

This suggests a possible arrhythmia or conduction issue.\n\n2. **Medical History**: She had a myocardial infarction 6 months ago and has multiple drug-eluting stents. This history increases the risk of cardiac conduction abnormalities.\n\n3. **Medications**: She is on methotrexate, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and aspirin. None of these medications are directly associated with causing arrhythmias, but they indicate she is being treated for cardiovascular disease.\n\n4. **Physical Exam**: She has an irregular heartbeat with normal cardiac sounds and mild lower extremity edema.

Dysfunction here can lead to atrial fibrillation, causing an irregular heartbeat.\n   - **Atrioventricular Node**: Issues here typically cause heart block, leading to bradycardia rather than an irregular rhythm.\n   - **Bundle of His, Bundle Branches, Purkinje Fibers**: These are involved in ventricular conduction. Problems here usually lead to bundle branch blocks or ventricular arrhythmias, not typically causing dizziness without syncope.\n\nGiven the irregular heartbeat and the likelihood of atrial fibrillation, the most probable component affected is the **Sinoatrial Node**.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with poorly managed hypertension over a long period of time most likely has compensatory hypertrophy of the heart. The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber. Treatment is with diuresis and treatment of the underlying heart failure.\n\nAnswer D: A holosystolic murmur heard at the apex describes mitral valve regurgitation. This would be possible if a papillary muscle had ruptured in an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment is with mitral valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer E: A normal S1 and S2 is possible but is less likely given this patient's long-standing history of poorly managed hypertension.

The myocardial infarction is particularly relevant for cardiac findings.\n\n2. **Current Medications**: The patient is prescribed metoprolol (a beta-blocker), aspirin (an antiplatelet), lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor), hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic), fluoxetine (an antidepressant), metformin, and insulin. These medications are typical for managing his conditions, but he has not been filling his prescriptions regularly, which might affect his blood pressure and heart rate control.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**: The patient has elevated blood pressure (180/120 mmHg) and a slightly elevated pulse rate (96/min). These findings suggest poor control of hypertension, possibly due to non-adherence to medication.\n\n4. **Laboratory Values**: The lab results show normal electrolytes, slightly elevated glucose, and normal renal function. These do not directly indicate any specific cardiac abnormality.\n\n5. **Expected Cardiac Findings**: Given the history of myocardial infarction, one common cardiac finding is the presence of a third heart sound (S3), which is often associated with heart failure or volume overload.

Fresh frozen plasma is the most effective therapy for hereditary angioedema of the options listed.\n\nAngioedema is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with severe edema of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. It can be caused by antigens, medications, and trauma or may occur spontaneously. It often presents with notable edema of the lips and tongue and may threaten the airway. There are 3 subtypes. Hereditary and acquired angioedema occur secondary to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. As a result, the most effective therapy is to administer fresh frozen plasma which has C1-esterase inhibitor. On the other hand, drug-induced angioedema (often from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) does not respond well to C1-esterase inhibitor replacement and supportive therapy; discontinuing the offending agent is the mainstay of therapy. Other effective but costly treatments that can be used in hereditary angioedema include: icatibant, ecallantide, and C1 inhibitor.\n\nPaige and Anderson note the management of hereditary angioedema. They review the different treatments and discuss C1-esterase inhibitor replacement. They recommend this treatment for acute episodes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Dexamethasone and other steroids can be given in acute allergic reactions and may reduce the recurrence of symptoms but are unlikely to be effective in angioedema, nor are they the most effective therapy. Steroids can take up to 4 hours to begin having any effect.\n\nAnswer B: Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that could be given for anaphylaxis or urticaria and works immediately; however, it is not the mainstay of therapy for angioedema nor is it the most effective therapy. It is the mainstay of therapy for urticaria. It can also be given in anaphylaxis.\n\nAnswer C: Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis which presents with urticaria, upper airway swelling, hypotension, nausea/vomiting, and wheezing. It is often given in angioedema but has limited efficacy when compared to fresh frozen plasma.\n\nAnswer E: Tranexamic acid is effective in treating angioedema and current evidence supports its use; however, the mainstay of therapy is still fresh frozen plasma.

The fact that the patient has experienced similar symptoms before suggests a recurrent condition, possibly hereditary angioedema.\n\n3. **Vital Signs and Examination**: The patient's vital signs are stable, and his oxygen saturation is normal, indicating that while he has difficulty breathing, he is not in immediate respiratory distress. The absence of a rash and a soft, nontender abdomen further supports angioedema rather than an allergic reaction like anaphylaxis.\n\n4. **Treatment Options**:\n   - **Dexamethasone (A)**: A corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation, but not typically effective for acute angioedema.\n   - **Diphenhydramine (B)**: An antihistamine used for allergic reactions, but not effective for hereditary angioedema.\n   - **Epinephrine (C)**: Used for anaphylaxis, but not effective for hereditary angioedema.\n   - **Fresh frozen plasma (D)**: Contains C1 esterase inhibitor, which can be effective for hereditary angioedema.\n   - **Tranexamic acid (E)**: An antifibrinolytic agent, not typically used for angioedema.\n\n5. **Most Effective Therapy**: Given the presentation and history, hereditary angioedema is likely.

The most appropriate initial therapy is light therapy, behavioral therapy, and sleep hygiene practices in addition to decreasing exposure to light at night.\n\nDelayed sleep phase syndrome typically presents with individuals who naturally fall asleep very late and wake up very late. This becomes problematic when they attend school or have a job that requires them to wake up early. The most appropriate initial therapy for delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene practices, and bright light therapy. Bright light therapy involves consistent timed exposure to a light box to simulate natural outdoor light, with the hope of resetting the circadian rhythm and moving the sleep phase earlier. If these measures fail, or if a different diagnosis is suspected, a referral for polysomnography may be indicated.\n\nSletten et al. studied whether melatonin was effective in the treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome. They found that using this medication as an adjunct to sleep hygiene was effective in improving symptoms. They recommend using multimodal therapy for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ethosuximide is the treatment of choice for absence seizures. Though this patient does have episodes of blank staring, this likely does not represent a seizure as he is arousable to return to work by his boss. Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy. Though this patient does have sudden episodes of falling asleep while at work, this is more likely to be related to his sleep schedule. Patients with narcolepsy generally do not feel tired immediately before their episodes of sleep.\n\nAnswer E: Zolpidem is a muscle relaxant and hypnotic with the mechanism of action of a benzodiazepine. Though a drug like zolpidem could be used to help this patient fall asleep, the most appropriate first step is to address the patient's sleep hygiene prior to prescribing a potentially addictive drug.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep hygiene.",
