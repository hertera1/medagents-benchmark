        "raw_response": "To determine the range in which 95% of the population's intra-ocular pressure (IOP) would lie, we use the concept of standard deviation and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule). According to this rule, 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations from the mean.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean IOP = 25 mm Hg\n- Standard deviation = 10 mm Hg\n\nThe range for 95% of the population is calculated as:\nMean \u00b1 2 * Standard deviation\n\n= 25 mm Hg \u00b1 2 * 10 mm Hg\n= 25 mm Hg \u00b1 20 mm Hg\n\nTherefore, the range is:\n5 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this calculation. It seems there might be an error in the options or the question setup. Based on the standard deviation provided, the correct calculation should be 5 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg, but this is not listed as an option.",
