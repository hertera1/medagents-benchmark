It primarily assesses physical functioning and independence.\n\n2. **Correlation with Other Measures**: The study provides correlation coefficients between the Barthel Index and various other scales that measure different aspects of health and quality of life:\n   - **SF36**: The Barthel Index shows a strong correlation with the physical functioning dimension (r = 0.810) but weaker correlations with other dimensions like role emotional (r = 0.217).\n   - **Nottingham Health Profile**: Strong correlation with physical mobility (r = -0.840) but weak or non-significant correlation with sleep (r = -0.189, NS).\n   - **Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale**: Moderate negative correlation with depression (r = -0.563).\n   - **Life Satisfaction Index**: Moderate positive correlation (r = 0.361).\n   - **London Handicap Scale**: Strong correlation (r = 0.726).\n   - **Frenchay Activities Index**: Strong correlation (r = 0.826).\n\n3. **Interpretation of Correlations**: The Barthel Index correlates strongly with measures of physical functioning and mobility, which is expected given its focus on ADLs. However, it shows weaker correlations with emotional, mental health, and life satisfaction measures.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: While the Barthel Index is a good measure of physical functioning, it does not capture the full spectrum of outcomes related to emotional health, life satisfaction, and other dimensions of quality of life. The moderate to weak correlations with these other dimensions suggest that relying solely on the Barthel Index would not provide a comprehensive assessment of long-term outcomes for stroke patients.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) no",

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009).

The rate of mild cervical lesions (koilocytosis, warts, CIN I with and without koilocytosis) was compared with the rate of severe cervical lesions (CIN II and III, cervical carcinoma) in patients with mild vaginal lesions (warts and koilocytosis, and low-grade VAIN) and in patients with severe vaginal lesions (high-grade VAIN). Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis).\nIn patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions. In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non active\" cervical lesions. The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant.\nDoes vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia have the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia?",

This suggests a correlation between the severity of vaginal lesions and cervical lesions, indicating that mild lesions in one area are associated with mild lesions in the other.\n\n2. **Active vs. Non-Active Lesions:**\n   - In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non-active\" cervical lesions. This suggests that the activity level of lesions in the vagina correlates with the activity level of lesions in the cervix.\n\n3. **High-Grade vs. Low-Grade VAIN:**\n   - The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant. This indicates that the severity of VAIN does not significantly correlate with the severity of CIN.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe study shows some correlation between the activity and severity of lesions in the vagina and cervix, but it does not demonstrate a consistent pattern of evolution between VAIN and CIN. The lack of significant differences in cervical lesion severity among different grades of VAIN suggests that the natural history of VAIN may not be identical to that of CIN.\n\nTherefore, based on the study findings, the answer to whether vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia has the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is:\n\n(B) no",

We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients.\nNinety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.\nThe calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02).\nCan calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?",

This implies that while the traditional distinction is useful, the sacral sparing measurements offer more precise prognostic value.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The determination between complete and incomplete SCI is clinically relevant, but the study highlights that sacral sparing measurements can enhance prognostic accuracy. Therefore, while the traditional distinction remains relevant, it may not be the most precise method for predicting outcomes like independent ambulation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is clinically relevant, but there are more precise methods available for specific prognostic purposes.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n(A) yes",

The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.\nExperts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01).

        "question": "A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored.\nAnticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients.\nIs there a role for fondaparinux in perioperative bridging?",

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

Specifically, the odds ratio (OR) for later stage at diagnosis increases with both driving distance (OR = 1.488 per 100 driving miles, P = .037) and driving time (OR = 1.270 per driving hour, P = .016). \n   - The significant p-values (less than 0.05) indicate a statistically significant association between travel burden and later stage at diagnosis.\n\n2. **Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Patients:**\n   - The study found that time-to-treatment after diagnosis of CRC is associated with travel burden. Specifically, the time-to-treatment increases by 14.57 days per 100 driving miles (P = .002) and by 5.86 days per driving hour (P = .018).\n   - Again, the significant p-values indicate a statistically significant association between travel burden and delayed treatment.\n\n3. **Lung Cancer Patients:**\n   - The question does not provide specific data regarding lung cancer patients, so we cannot directly assess the impact of travel burden on lung cancer patients from the information given.\n\nBased on the data provided, travel burden (both driving distance and driving time) is associated with later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer patients and delayed treatment for colorectal cancer patients.

All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01).

The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.\nA total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC\u2009>\u20091 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.002).

This suggests that MRSA strains are becoming less susceptible to vancomycin over time.\n\n2. **Study Details**: The study in question was conducted in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal over a 3-year period (2007-2009). It assessed vancomycin MICs for MRSA isolates using the Etest method.\n\n3. **Results**: The study found fluctuations in the percentage of MRSA isolates with vancomycin MIC > 1 mg/L over the years: 86.2% in 2007, 93.3% in 2008, and 58.8% in 2009.

In fact, the percentage of isolates with MIC > 1 mg/L decreased in 2009 compared to previous years.\n\n5. **Global Perspective**: The study is limited to a single center in Portugal. While it provides valuable data, it does not offer evidence of a worldwide trend. The phenomenon of vancomycin MIC creep has been reported in various studies, but these are often localized to specific centers or regions.\n\n6. **Answering the Question**: Given the localized nature of the study and the lack of consistent evidence of MIC creep even within this single center, we cannot definitively say that vancomycin MIC creep is a worldwide phenomenon based solely on this study.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to the question \"Is vancomycin MIC creep a worldwide phenomenon?\" is:\n\n(C) maybe",

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records.

Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.\nOne thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10).

The patients were categorized into age groups 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years and older, then further categorized by treatment status. Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-specific survival (DSS) for late-stage (III and IV) OPSCC was performed for all age and treatment categories, followed by a multivariate cox regression of treatment status, tumor site, race, stage, and sex per age group.\nA total of 14,909 patients with OPSCC were identified. In our demographic data, we observed a significant increase in the number of patients who did not receive treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined therapy) after age 55. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 had substantial benefits in DSS with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy.

Patients are categorized into age groups and treatment status.\n\n2. **Treatment Trends**: The demographic data indicates a significant increase in the number of patients who did not receive treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined therapy) after age 55. This suggests a trend where older patients are less likely to receive aggressive treatment.\n\n3. **Survival Analysis**: Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 benefit substantially in disease-specific survival (DSS) from receiving surgery, radiation, or combined therapy.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management.\nA prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit.\nA total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p<0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most (58%) did not receive medical clearance.

Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40\u2005min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2\u2005weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.\nInterviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall.

The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion.\nIn this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.\nThe sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm.

        "question": "Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up.\nTreatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?",

Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion.

This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor.

        "raw_response": "To answer the question of whether bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation is still justifiable in high bleeding risk (HBR) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), we need to analyze the findings of the ZEUS trial.\n\n1. **Study Design and Population**: The ZEUS trial compared zotarolimus-eluting stents (E-ZES) with bare-metal stents (BMS) in patients with high bleeding risk. These patients were subjected to a 30-day dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) regimen.\n\n2. **Primary Endpoint**: The primary endpoint was the 12-month major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate, which included death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.\n\n3. **Results**:\n   - **MACE Rate**: Among HBR patients, the MACE rate was lower in the E-ZES group (22.6%) compared to the BMS group (29%), with a hazard ratio of 0.75, indicating a statistically significant reduction in adverse events for E-ZES.\n   - **Myocardial Infarction and Revascularization**: E-ZES patients had lower rates of myocardial infarction (3.5% vs. 10.4%) and target vessel revascularization (5.9% vs. 11.4%).\n   - **Stent Thrombosis**: The composite of definite or probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced in E-ZES recipients.\n   - **Bleeding Events**: There was no significant difference in bleeding events between the E-ZES and BMS groups.\n\n4. **Interpretation**: The use of E-ZES in HBR patients resulted in better ischemic outcomes without increasing bleeding risks compared to BMS. The significant reduction in myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, and stent thrombosis suggests that E-ZES offers superior protection against ischemic events.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the improved outcomes with E-ZES and no increase in bleeding risk, the use of BMS is less justifiable in HBR patients. The data supports the use of drug-eluting stents like E-ZES over BMS in this population.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether bare-metal stent implantation is still justifiable in high bleeding risk patients undergoing PCI is:\n\n(B) no",

Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells.

This implies that the subscale may be more reflective of emotional and subjective experiences rather than direct cognitive impairments.\n\n3. **Variance Contribution**: Multivariate analyses showed that symptoms of depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive Scores, and anxiety contributed an additional 6%. This further supports the idea that the subscale is more associated with emotional states rather than cognitive function.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale is not related to objective cognitive measures but is related to emotional symptoms and subjective complaints, it does not directly identify cognitive impairments.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(B) no",
