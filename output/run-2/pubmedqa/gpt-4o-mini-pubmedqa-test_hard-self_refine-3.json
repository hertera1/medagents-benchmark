This is a key finding that supports the hypothesis that antral follicle count is associated with better IVF outcomes.\n\n2. **Controlling for Other Factors**: The solution notes that the study controls for maternal age and basal FSH levels, and still finds a significant difference in pregnancy rates based on antral follicle count. This is an important point, as it suggests that antral follicle count provides additional predictive value beyond age and FSH, which is a critical aspect of the study's conclusions.\n\n3. **Cancellation Rates**: The solution highlights the significant difference in cancellation rates between the two groups, reinforcing the idea that a higher antral follicle count is associated with fewer cancellations. This is relevant because it indicates that not only does a higher count correlate with better pregnancy rates, but it also correlates with a more successful IVF cycle overall.\n\n4. **Comparison with Age and FSH**: The solution correctly points out that while age and FSH are established predictors of IVF outcomes, the data suggests that antral follicle count may provide more specific information. This is a nuanced understanding of the study's implications, as it suggests that antral follicle count could be a more direct measure of ovarian reserve and response to stimulation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The solution concludes that antral follicle assessment is a valuable predictor of IVF outcomes and may be a better predictor than age and FSH.

While sulfasalazine can cause side effects, the specific combination of symptoms in this case suggests a severe systemic reaction rather than a typical response to the medication.\n\n3. **Crohn's Disease vs. Other Conditions**: \n   - Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can cause granulomatous inflammation in the intestines. The presence of granulomatous enteritis strongly suggests a connection to Crohn's disease.\n   - However, the severe systemic reactions (eosinophilia, myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures) may indicate a drug reaction rather than a primary disease process.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: While the presence of granulomatous enteritis is suggestive of Crohn's disease, the severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine complicates the diagnosis. The symptoms could be a result of the drug rather than an indication of Crohn's disease itself.\n\nGiven the information, the most accurate answer is that the condition described is likely not Crohn's disease but rather a severe reaction to sulfasalazine that mimics some of the symptoms associated with it.\n\nFinal answer: **B** (no)."

Little is known about the relation of another newly discovered agent, the TT virus, with chronic liver disease.AIM: To investigate the rate of infection with hepatitis G virus and TT virus in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease.\nA total of 23 subjects with chronically raised alanine transaminase and a liver biopsy in whom all known causes of liver disease had been excluded, and 40 subjects with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease.\nEvaluation of anti-hepatitis G virus by enzyme immunoassay. Hepatitis G virus-RNA by polymerase chain reaction with primers from the 5' NC and NS5a regions. TT virus-DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction with primers from the ORF1 region. Results. Hepatitis G virus-RNA was detected in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and in 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis (17.4% vs 15% p=ns). At least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus, mostly mutually exclusive) was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic hepatitis and 16 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus liver disease (26. 1% vs 40% p=ns). T virus-DNA was present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Demographic and clinical features, including stage and grade of liver histology, were comparable between hepatitis G virus-infected and uninfected subjects. Severe liver damage [chronic hepatitis with fibrosis or cirrhosis) were significantly more frequent in subjects with hepatitis C virus liver disease.\nAre hepatitis G virus and TT virus involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease?",

However, there are some nuances and potential oversights that should be addressed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n1. **Study Design**: The solution correctly identifies the study as a prospective randomized trial, which is appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the two techniques.\n\n2. **Patient Population**: The solution accurately notes that 240 adult patients were included, which is a reasonable sample size for this type of study.\n\n3. **Techniques Compared**: The description of the techniques used in both groups is accurate. The landmark group relied on respiratory jugular venodilation, while the ultrasound group used imaging to locate the vein.\n\n4. **Results for Patients with Identified Jugular Venodilation**: \n   - The solution correctly states that there were no significant differences in cannulation success rates between the two groups when the landmark was identifiable. However, it incorrectly states that the incidence of arterial puncture was \"not a significant difference,\" when in fact the data shows a lower incidence in the ultrasound group (1.0% vs. 3.3%), which could be interpreted as clinically relevant, even if not statistically significant.\n\n5. **Results for Patients without Identified Jugular Venodilation**: \n   - The solution accurately highlights the significant advantages of ultrasound in this subgroup, including higher access and success rates and a lower incidence of arterial puncture. This is a critical finding that supports the utility of ultrasound in challenging cases.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion drawn in the solution is valid. It emphasizes that ultrasound is particularly beneficial when traditional landmarks are not identifiable, which is a key takeaway from the study.\n\n**Final Evaluation**: The solution is mostly correct, but it could improve by clarifying the interpretation of the arterial puncture rates in the landmark group when the landmark was identifiable. The statement about the significance of the arterial puncture rates could be misleading, as it implies that there was no difference when there was a lower incidence in the ultrasound group.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would say that the solution is correct in its overall conclusion but could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of the results regarding arterial puncture rates. Therefore, I would return **True**, as the main conclusion about the facilitation of cannulation by ultrasound is supported by the data, but with the caveat that the interpretation of the arterial puncture rates should be more precise.",

The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).\nUnlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia.

From this pool of 1,003 examinations, 994 were included in our study. Examinations showing at least one polyp or carcinoma 5 mm or larger were considered to have positive results. For combined readings, results were considered positive if either of the two interpreters reported finding a polyp or carcinoma. A McNemar test was used to compare the first reader's results with the combined results of the first and second readers. Results were retrospectively correlated with endoscopic or surgical results in 360 patients, and agreement between first and combined readings and endoscopic results was determined.\nAdding a second reader increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315 (p<0.0001) and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%). Sensitivity of the first and combined readings for detection of all lesions was identical, 76.3% (95% CI, 65.4-87.1%). Specificity decreased from 91.0% (95% CI, 87.9-94.3%) for the first reading to 86.4% (95% CI, 82.2-90.0%) for the combined reading.

The decrease in specificity from 91.0% to 86.4% indicates a higher rate of false positives, which could lead to unnecessary follow-up procedures and anxiety for patients.\n\n4. **Agreement Between Readers**: The solution mentions the decrease in kappa value, indicating a reduction in agreement between the first and second readers. This is a significant concern, as it suggests that the second reading may introduce variability rather than enhance reliability. The solution should emphasize that a lower kappa value indicates less consistency, which is a strong argument against the necessity of double reading.\n\n5. **Time Requirement**: While the average time of 3.3 minutes for the second reading is mentioned, the solution does not discuss the implications of this time requirement in the context of clinical efficiency and resource allocation. In busy clinical settings, even a few extra minutes can be significant, especially if the benefits of double reading are not clear.\n\n6. **Detection of Adenocarcinomas**: The claim that sensitivity for detecting adenocarcinomas was 100% is indeed a strong point for double reading. However, the solution does not adequately weigh this against the overall findings regarding specificity and agreement. The necessity of double reading should be evaluated in the context of the overall performance metrics, not just one type of lesion.\n\nIn summary, the solution does not accurately reflect the implications of the study's findings and fails to provide a balanced view of the benefits and drawbacks of double reading. The conclusion that double reading is \"maybe\" necessary does not adequately consider the significant concerns raised by the decrease in specificity and agreement. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.",

This indicates that double reading can identify more cases that may require clinical attention.\n\n2. **Impact on Clinical Treatment**: The potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%) suggests that double reading can have a significant impact on patient management. This is an important consideration in clinical practice.\n\n3. **Sensitivity and Specificity**: The sensitivity for detecting all lesions remained the same at 76.3% for both the first and combined readings. However, the specificity decreased from 91.0% to 86.4% with the combined reading. This means that while the ability to detect true positives did not improve, the likelihood of false positives increased with double reading.\n\n4. **Agreement Between Readers**: The overall measurement of agreement (kappa value) decreased from 61.8 to 52.9 when comparing the first reading to the combined reading. This suggests that the second reader may not always agree with the first reader, which could complicate interpretations.\n\n5. **Time Requirement**: The second reading required an average of 3.3 minutes. While this is a relatively short time, it is still an additional resource that needs to be considered in a clinical setting.\n\n6. **Detection of Adenocarcinomas**: The sensitivity for detecting adenocarcinomas was reported to be 100%, which is a strong argument for the necessity of double reading, especially for serious conditions like cancer.\n\nConsidering these points, the necessity of double reading can be argued from the perspective of increased detection rates and potential changes in patient management. However, the decrease in specificity and agreement raises concerns about the reliability of the second reading.\n\nIn conclusion, while double reading has its benefits, the trade-offs in specificity and agreement suggest that it may not be universally necessary for all cases. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the question \"is it necessary?\" would be:\n\n**C (maybe)**. \n\nThis reflects the nuanced nature of the findings, indicating that while double reading can be beneficial, its necessity may depend on specific clinical contexts and patient needs."

However, the solution does not adequately address the implications of these ratings. While the mean ratings suggest a general trend, they do not provide a definitive answer to the question of acceptability across all scenarios. The mean ratings alone do not imply that breaching confidentiality is universally accepted; rather, they reflect a tendency that varies significantly among the groups.\n\n2. **Diversity of Opinions**: The cluster analysis reveals a nuanced perspective among lay participants, with a significant number (87 out of 144) indicating that acceptability depends on circumstances. This suggests that while many lay people may find it acceptable under certain conditions, there is no consensus that it is always acceptable. The solution does not emphasize this variability, which is crucial for understanding the overall acceptability.\n\n3. **Physician Perspective**: The solution states that physicians are much less likely to agree with breaching confidentiality. This is an important point, as it highlights a professional ethical stance that may prioritize patient confidentiality over the potential benefits of informing a spouse. The solution does not sufficiently explore the implications of this difference in perspective, which is critical to answering the original question.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The conclusion states \"yes\" to the question of whether French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality.

This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD.\nRecords of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval higher than 95%.\nOverall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups.\nAre the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through?",

However, there are several critical points that need to be addressed to evaluate the correctness of the solution.\n\n1. **Target Population**: The solution correctly identifies the target population as cinema patrons aged 12-24 years, with a notable percentage of current smokers. This is an important aspect of the study.\n\n2. **Study Design**: The solution accurately describes the quasi-experimental design, noting the intervention and control groups. This is essential for understanding the context of the findings.\n\n3. **Perceptions of Smoking in Movies**:\n   - The solution correctly interprets the results for non-smokers, indicating a statistically significant positive effect of the advertisement on their perceptions (47.8% vs. 43.8%, p = 0.04).\n   - However, the interpretation of the results for smokers is misleading. While it states that there was no significant difference in perceptions between the intervention and control groups (16.5% vs. 14.5%, p = 0.4), it fails to emphasize that this lack of change suggests that the advertisement did not have any positive effect on smokers' perceptions, which is a critical point.\n\n4. **Intention to Smoke**:\n   - The solution correctly notes that smokers in the intervention group showed a higher intention to smoke in 12 months (38.6% vs. 25.6%, p < 0.001), indicating a negative effect of the advertisement on smokers' intentions. This is a significant finding that should be highlighted more prominently.\n   - For non-smokers, the solution accurately states that there was no significant difference in smoking intentions between the groups (1.2% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.54), indicating that the advertisement did not influence non-smokers' intentions to smoke.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion drawn in the solution is somewhat misleading. While it states that the advertisement had a positive effect on non-smokers' perceptions, it does not adequately address the negative effect on smokers' intentions. The statement that the advertisement influenced perceptions but not in a uniformly positive way across all groups is somewhat vague and could lead to confusion.\n\nOverall, the solution contains accurate interpretations of the data but lacks clarity and emphasis on the negative effects observed in smokers. The conclusion could be more precise in summarizing the overall impact of the advertisement.\n\nGiven these points, I am more than 95 percent confident that the solution is incorrect due to its misleading conclusions and lack of emphasis on the negative effects observed in smokers. Therefore, I return **False** and provide the following feedback:\n\n**Feedback on the error**: The solution misrepresents the overall impact of the advertisement by not clearly stating the negative effect it had on smokers' intentions to smoke. It should emphasize that while the advertisement positively influenced non-smokers' perceptions, it had a detrimental effect on smokers' intentions, which is a critical finding of the study.",

The clinical relevance of this finding should be discussed. A difference of 3 infections (4 in the shaved group vs. 1 in the unshaved group) in a large sample size may not be clinically significant, especially if the overall infection rates are low.\n\n- **Potential Confounding Factors**: The solution does not mention any potential confounding factors that could influence infection rates, such as the type of surgery, the surgeons' experience, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, or the patients' underlying health conditions. These factors could affect the validity of the conclusion.\n\n- **Randomization and Blinding**: The solution does not discuss whether the randomization was successful or if blinding was used in the study.

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\nMidwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",

Rural midwives reported higher competence in breech delivery, while urban midwives reported higher competence in intravenous fluid replacement and newborn examinations.

To ascertain whether this reported association could be replicated in a different country, it was re-examined in 300 individuals with Type 1 diabetes.\nPeople with Type 1 diabetes, none of whom was taking renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs, were recruited. Participants recorded the frequency with which they had experienced SH. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and serum ACE were measured. The difference in the incidence of SH between different quartiles of ACE activity and the relationship between serum ACE and SH were examined using non-parametric statistical tests and a negative binomial model.\nData were obtained from 300 patients [158 male; HbA(1c) median (range) 8.2% (5.2-12.8%), median age 36 years (16-88); duration of diabetes 14.5 years (2-49)]. The incidence of SH was 0.93 episodes per patient year. The mean incidence of SH in the top and bottom quartiles of ACE activity was 0.5 and 1.7 episodes per patient year, respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.075).

While a low recurrence rate is generally a positive sign, the solution fails to consider the context of the study. The study population is limited to a specific group (node-negative breast cancer patients), and the recurrence rate alone does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that chest wall irradiation is unnecessary.\n\n2. **Lack of Statistical Significance**: The solution acknowledges that the factors associated with increased risk of local failure (age \u2264 40 years and tumor size > 20 mm) did not reach statistical significance.

The solution should emphasize that without statistical significance, the association is weak and should not be used to justify changes in treatment protocols.\n\n3. **Recurrence Sites and Treatment Implications**: The solution suggests that the recurrence sites (operative scar and chest wall) indicate a potential benefit for chest wall irradiation. However, it does not adequately address the fact that the study's focus was on the internal mammary chain, and the recurrence in the chest wall may not necessarily imply that chest wall irradiation would have been beneficial. The study does not provide evidence that chest wall irradiation would reduce recurrence rates in this specific patient population.\n\n4. **Conclusion and Recommendation**: The conclusion that chest wall irradiation \"could provide additional protection\" is speculative and not supported by the data presented in the study. The solution should be more cautious in its recommendations, especially given the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of chest wall irradiation in this specific cohort.\n\nIn summary, the solution overstates the implications of the study's findings and fails to critically evaluate the evidence regarding the necessity of chest wall irradiation in node-negative breast cancer patients.

The severity of parenchymal inflammation and of interface hepatitis was semiquantitatively graded on a haematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections. Additionally, 50 more HCC, formed on HBV basis, were studied to determine the prevalence of c-kit overexpression.\nIn cirrhotic liver, lower intensity of staining and rarely c-kit positivity were present. The greatest number of the c-kit positivity and higher intensity of staining was found in the livers of patients with severe hepatitis and HCC. In chronic hepatitis B infection, the staining intensity was parallel with the grade and stage of the disease. In the areas where fibrosis was seen, c-kit positivity was rare or absent. In the HCC specimens, c-kit positivity appeared both inside and around the cancerous nodes.

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1.\nDoes the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?",

        "question": "Assessing the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients consists of periodical clinical evaluations and laboratory tests. We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients.\nNinety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.\nThe calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02).\nCan calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?",

While the child has features of Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and has developed tuberculosis, the normal immunological work-up indicates that she does not have a compromised immune system that would typically lead to such infections. \n\n6. **Conclusion**: The presence of Say-Barber-Miller syndrome does not appear to directly cause tuberculosis in this case, especially since the child is immunocompetent. The relationship may be coincidental rather than causative.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n**B** (no)"

The risk of recurrent stroke increases substantially with age, as does the potential benefit of secondary prevention. In order to develop effective strategies for older patients, it is important to identify how stroke care is currently provided for this patient group.\nBetween 2004 and 2006, older patients (>75 years) referred to a neurovascular clinic were compared with younger patients (<or =75 years). Sociodemographic details, clinical features, resource use and secondary prevention in a neurovascular clinic were collected.\nOf 379 patients referred to the clinic, 129 (34%) were given a non-stroke diagnosis. Of the remaining 250 patients, 149 (60%) were<or =75 years. Median time from symptom onset to clinic appointment was similar for the two groups (24 (IQR 15-42) vs 24 (IQR 14-43) days; p = 0.58). Older patients were more likely to be in atrial fibrillation (10.1% vs 22.8%, p<0.001) and have lacunar stroke (34.7% vs 22.1%; p = 0.04). CT rates were similar in the two groups (27.8% vs 80.0%, p = 0.75). Scans were performed more quickly in younger patients (p<0.01).

However, there are several critical points to evaluate regarding the correctness of the conclusion that older patients do not receive adequate stroke care.\n\n1. **Patient Demographics**: The solution correctly identifies the demographics of the patient groups. It notes that older patients represent a significant portion of those diagnosed with stroke-related issues.\n\n2. **Clinical Features**: The solution highlights that older patients have more complex health issues, such as a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and lacunar strokes. This is an important observation, as it suggests that older patients may require more tailored care due to their comorbidities.\n\n3. **Resource Use**:\n   - The solution correctly notes that CT scan rates were similar, but younger patients had quicker access to scans. However, the interpretation of the significance of this finding could be nuanced. While quicker access is beneficial, the overall rate of CT scans being similar suggests that both groups are receiving necessary imaging.\n   - The significant difference in MRI scan rates (higher in younger patients) and carotid Doppler imaging (also higher in younger patients) indicates a disparity in diagnostic resources. This is a valid concern and suggests that older patients may not be receiving comprehensive diagnostic evaluations.\n\n4. **Secondary Prevention**:\n   - The solution states that there were no differences in prescribed secondary preventive treatments, which is a critical point. This suggests that despite differences in diagnostic imaging, the treatment provided to both groups is equivalent. This is a strong argument in favor of the adequacy of care for older patients.\n   - The lack of lifestyle advice for older patients is a valid concern, as lifestyle modifications are important for secondary prevention. However, the absence of such advice does not necessarily equate to inadequate care, especially if pharmacological treatments are being managed appropriately.\n\n5. **Surgical Interventions**:\n   - The solution notes that older patients experienced less delay for carotid endarterectomy, which is a positive aspect of their care. This indicates that, at least in terms of surgical intervention, older patients are receiving timely care.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The conclusion that older patients do not receive adequate stroke care is based on the disparities in diagnostic imaging and lifestyle advice. However, the fact that secondary preventive treatments are similar and that surgical interventions are timely complicates this conclusion.\n   - The solution does not adequately weigh the importance of the equivalence in secondary prevention treatments against the disparities in diagnostic imaging and lifestyle advice. The overall care may still be considered adequate if the critical aspects of treatment (i.e., medications) are being managed effectively.\n\nIn summary, while there are valid concerns regarding the disparities in diagnostic imaging and lifestyle advice for older patients, the conclusion that they do not receive adequate stroke care overlooks the equivalence in secondary prevention treatments and timely surgical interventions. Therefore, the solution's final answer is not fully justified.\n\nFinal answer: **False**.

The MR images were evaluated for disc degeneration, disc contour abnormalities, HIZ, and endplate abnormalities. Based on the combination of an HIZ and disc contour abnormalities, four classes were determined: (1) normal or bulging disc without HIZ; (2) normal or bulging disc with HIZ; (3) disc protrusion without HIZ; (4) disc protrusion with HIZ.

        "question": "Opioid-dependent patients often have co-occurring chronic illnesses requiring medications that interact with methadone. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is typically provided separately from medical care. Hence, coordination of medical care and substance use treatment is important to preserve patient safety.\nTo identify potential safety risks among MMT patients engaged in medical care by evaluating the frequency that opioid dependence and MMT documentation are missing in medical records and characterizing potential medication-methadone interactions.\nAmong patients from a methadone clinic who received primary care from an affiliated, but separate, medical center, we reviewed electronic medical records for documentation of methadone, opioid dependence, and potential drug-methadone interactions. The proportions of medical records without opioid dependence and methadone documentation were estimated and potential medication-methadone interactions were identified.\nAmong the study subjects (n = 84), opioid dependence documentation was missing from the medical record in 30% (95% CI, 20%-41%) and MMT documentation was missing from either the last primary care note or the last hospital discharge summary in 11% (95% CI, 5%-19%). Sixty-nine percent of the study subjects had at least 1 medication that potentially interacted with methadone; 19% had 3 or more potentially interacting medications.\nAre opioid dependence and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) documented in the medical record?",

However, there are some nuances and potential issues that need to be addressed for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n1. **Opioid Dependence Documentation**: The solution correctly states that opioid dependence documentation was missing in 30% of cases, which implies that it was documented in 70% of cases. This is a straightforward interpretation of the data.\n\n2. **MMT Documentation**: Similarly, the solution accurately notes that MMT documentation was missing in 11% of cases, indicating that it was documented in 89% of cases. This is also a correct interpretation.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that both opioid dependence and MMT are documented in the medical records for the majority of patients is valid. However, the solution could benefit from a more nuanced discussion about the implications of the missing documentation. While the majority of cases have documentation, the missing documentation in 30% and 11% of cases, respectively, raises concerns about the potential safety risks for patients who may not have their opioid dependence or MMT status communicated effectively among healthcare providers.\n\n4. **Safety Implications**: The solution does not address the potential consequences of the missing documentation. Given that opioid-dependent patients may be prescribed medications that interact with methadone, the lack of documentation could lead to unsafe prescribing practices and adverse drug interactions. This is a critical aspect of the problem that should be highlighted.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The final answer of \"A (yes)\" is technically correct in that the majority of patients do have documentation of opioid dependence and MMT. However, it could be misleading if interpreted to mean that there are no significant concerns regarding patient safety due to the missing documentation.\n\nIn summary, while the solution is correct in its analysis of the data, it lacks a discussion of the implications of the missing documentation and the associated safety risks.

Yet many clinicians are concerned about overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers.\nWe developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.\nExperts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001).

However, there are several critical points to evaluate regarding the correctness of the solution.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The solution correctly identifies the context of the study, which focuses on women receiving AC between 24-32 weeks of gestation. This is an important foundation for the analysis.\n\n2. **Key Findings**: The solution accurately summarizes the key findings from the study, including the percentages of women who delivered at or after 34 weeks, within 1 week, and within 24 hours of receiving AC. This is essential for understanding the implications of the data.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis**: The solution mentions the comparison between women who delivered before 34 weeks after 1 week of receiving AC and those who delivered more than 2 weeks after AC but at or after 34 weeks. However, it does not delve deeply into the implications of these comparisons. The odds ratios (OR) provided in the study indicate that certain risk factors significantly increase the likelihood of earlier delivery, which is crucial for understanding which groups might benefit from rescue AC.\n\n4. **Implications for Rescue AC**: The solution suggests that there is a potential opportunity for rescue AC based on the data. However, it does not adequately address the fact that the majority of women (82.1%) who remained pregnant for more than a week after AC still delivered before 34 weeks. This raises questions about the effectiveness and timing of administering rescue AC. The solution should clarify that while there may be a potential opportunity for rescue AC, the actual benefit would depend on individual risk factors and clinical judgment.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion drawn in the solution is somewhat ambiguous. While it states that there is a potential opportunity for rescue AC, it does not sufficiently consider the overall context of the findings. The majority of women did not remain pregnant long enough to warrant additional AC, and the study's findings suggest that the timing and indication for rescue AC would need to be carefully evaluated.\n\nIn summary, while the solution provides a reasonable analysis of the data, it lacks depth in discussing the implications of the findings and the actual opportunity for rescue AC. The conclusion may lead to an overly optimistic interpretation of the potential for rescue AC without adequately considering the majority of cases where it may not be applicable.\n\nGiven these points, I am more than 95 percent confident that the solution is incorrect in its conclusion about the opportunity for rescue AC. Therefore, I return **False** and provide the following feedback:\n\n**Feedback**: The solution does not adequately consider the majority of women who did not remain pregnant long enough to benefit from rescue AC. While there may be a potential opportunity for some women, the overall data suggests that the majority delivered before 34 weeks, which complicates the justification for administering additional AC.

We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack.\nTemperature was monitored using the Thermobouton probe during preservation of pig kidneys, in the same conditions used with human grafts. The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008.\nThe temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice were used.

Among these, 132 children had a history of atopic dermatitis (AD).\n\n2. **Infection Prevalence**: The study reported the prevalence of skin infections among the children:\n   - Impetigo contagiosum (IC): 45.1% in children with AD\n   - Molluscum contagiosum (MC): 19.7% in children with AD\n   - Herpes virus infection (HI): 2.5% in children with AD\n\n3. **Odds Ratios**: The study found that the odds of having a history of impetigo (IC) were 1.8 times higher in children with AD compared to those without AD. This suggests a significant association between AD and the prevalence of impetigo.\n\n4. **Molluscum Contagiosum**: The study indicated that a history of MC was significantly correlated with male gender but not with a personal history of AD. This means that while there is a prevalence of MC in children with AD, it is not directly associated with having AD.\n\n5. **Herpes Virus Infection**: The study found no correlated factors for herpes virus infection (HI) in relation to AD, indicating that there is no significant association between HI and AD.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the findings:\n   - There is a clear increase in the prevalence of impetigo contagiosum in children with atopic dermatitis.\n   - There is no significant association between atopic dermatitis and molluscum contagiosum.\n   - There is no significant association between atopic dermatitis and herpes virus infection.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the lifetime prevalence of impetigo is indeed increased in children with atopic dermatitis, while the evidence for molluscum contagiosum and herpes virus infection does not support an increase.\n\nFinal answer: **(A)** yes",

        "question": "A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored.\nAnticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients.\nIs there a role for fondaparinux in perioperative bridging?",

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold.\nDoes combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?",

We determined the agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 6.0\u00a0mm.\nThe mean (\u00b1standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 \u00b1 0.70\u00a0mm with SLBM and 6.26 \u00b1 0.68\u00a0mm with CIP (p\u2009=\u20090.01) averaging both examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60\u00a0mm and -0.30\u00a0mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30\u00a0mm. The ICCs were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09\u00a0mm. Kappa statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity ranged from 5.4\u00a0mm to 6.2\u00a0mm.\nCan we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method?",
        "answer": "no",
        "answer_rationale": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.",

It aimed to assess the relationship between composite measures derived from process indicators and short-term outcomes (postoperative mortality and morbidity).\n\n2. **Patient-Level Findings**: At the patient level, it was noted that only one composite measure was negatively associated with morbidity for rectum carcinoma. This suggests that there is limited consistency at the patient level, as only one measure showed a negative association.\n\n3. **Hospital-Level Findings**: At the hospital level, the results were more promising. There was a strong negative association between composite measures and hospital mortality and morbidity rates for rectum carcinoma, as well as hospital morbidity rates for colon carcinoma. This indicates that hospitals with better process measures tend to have better outcomes, suggesting a level of consistency.\n\n4. **Overall Consistency**: The findings indicate that while there is some level of consistency at the hospital level, the patient level shows limited association. This mixed result suggests that while composite measures can reflect quality of care to some extent, they do not uniformly correlate with outcomes across all levels.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the mixed results, particularly the lack of strong associations at the patient level, the overall conclusion is that the composite measures are not consistently aligned with short-term outcomes.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n**B** (no)"

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease.\nThe prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment.\nCoronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs.

The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.\nA total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC\u2009>\u20091 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.002).

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records.

The present study was launched contemporarily to the implementation of analgesia for labor in our Department in order to perform a 2 years audit on its use. The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth.\nThis audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects.\nDuring the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p<0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5\u00b11.4 before to 4.1\u00b11.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12\u00b11.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76\u00b10.79 after (p<0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after).

Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk.\nData from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.\nOne thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with \u22653 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98).\nIs digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate cancer?",

Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.\nSchanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases.

This is important context for understanding the population being studied.\n\n2. **Correlation Analysis**: The solution correctly notes that both Pearson and Spearman tests were used to assess the relationship between epicardial fat tissue thickness and serum PON 1 levels. This is appropriate given the nature of the data.\n\n3. **Findings on Correlation**: The solution accurately reports that the correlation coefficient was -0.127 with a p-value of 0.069, indicating no statistically significant linear correlation. This is a critical point, as it suggests that there is no direct linear relationship between the two variables.\n\n4. **Grouped Analysis**: The solution correctly identifies that when epicardial fat tissue thickness was categorized into groups, there was a significant difference in serum PON 1 levels between the groups. This is an important finding, as it suggests that while there may not be a linear correlation, there are differences in PON 1 levels based on the thickness of epicardial fat tissue.\n\n5. **Other Findings**: The solution mentions other findings related to hypertension prevalence, serum triglycerides, and body mass index, which are relevant as they may confound the relationship between epicardial fat thickness and PON 1 levels.\n\n**Final Evaluation**: The conclusion drawn in the solution is that there is no linear correlation between serum PON 1 levels and epicardial fat tissue thickness, which is supported by the statistical analysis. However, the significant differences in PON 1 levels between the grouped categories suggest that there may be a relationship that is not linear, which the solution does not fully explore.\n\nThus, while the solution correctly states that there is no linear correlation, it could be misleading to conclude that there is \"no relationship\" at all, as the grouped analysis indicates that PON 1 levels do vary with epicardial fat thickness. Therefore, the final answer of \"no\" may oversimplify the findings.\n\nGiven this nuanced understanding, I would argue that the solution is not entirely correct in its final conclusion. The relationship may not be linear, but there is evidence of a relationship when considering the grouped data.\n\n**Final Answer: False.** The solution oversimplifies the relationship by stating there is \"no\" relationship, despite evidence of differences in PON 1 levels based on epicardial fat thickness categories.",

        "question": "More than 50,000 new HIV infections occur annually in the United States. Injection drug users represent twelve percent of incident HIV infections each year. Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between OTC syringe sales and crime.\nWe used a geographic information system and novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling pharmacies.\nBy December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts. Using generalized estimating equations and adjusting for potential confounders, reported crime rates were negatively associated with OTC syringe sales (adjusted rate ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.81, 0.99).\nIs crime associated with over-the-counter pharmacy syringe sales?",

Patients were categorized into age groups, and it was noted that there was a significant increase in the number of patients who did not receive any treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined therapy) after age 55. This indicates a trend where older patients are less likely to receive treatment.\n\n2. **Treatment Status**: The data indicates that as patients age, particularly after 55, there is a notable trend of receiving less treatment. This suggests that elderly patients may be less likely to receive aggressive therapies that could potentially improve their outcomes.\n\n3. **Kaplan-Meier Analysis**: The analysis showed that age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 experienced substantial benefits in disease-specific survival (DSS) when they received surgery, radiation, or combined therapy. This implies that treatment is beneficial for these age groups, reinforcing the idea that treatment can lead to better outcomes.\n\n4. **Multivariable Analysis**: The multivariable analysis did not show statistically significant differences in hazard ratios for combined treatment among the various age groups (45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84). This could suggest that when treatment is given, the outcomes are similar across these age groups. However, it does not negate the fact that older patients are receiving less treatment overall.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the evidence that elderly patients (especially those over 55) are receiving less treatment and that those who do receive treatment benefit from it, it can be concluded that elderly patients with OPSCC are indeed undertreated.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n**A (yes)**. \n\nThis conclusion is supported by the data indicating a significant increase in untreated elderly patients and the observed benefits of treatment in those who do receive it."

        "question": "Concussions are commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management.\nA prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit.\nA total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p<0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most (58%) did not receive medical clearance.

This is an important detail that establishes the context of the research.\n\n3. **Methods of Feedback**: The solution correctly describes the randomization of parents into two groups receiving different feedback methods (BPC and MI).\n\n4. **Follow-Up**: The follow-up participation rate of 90% is noted, which is a strong aspect of the study, indicating good retention of participants for the recall assessment.\n\n5. **Recall Results**: The solution accurately reports that parents recalled only 39% of the information, indicating a low level of recall. This is a critical finding of the study.\n\n6. **Comparison of Feedback Methods**: The solution correctly states that parents receiving BPC recalled more information than those receiving MI, highlighting a significant difference in recall based on the feedback method.\n\n7. **Understanding of Weight Status**: The solution points out that while a high percentage of parents could recall their child's weight status, very few could accurately describe what the measurements meant.

This conclusion is justified based on the evidence presented in the study, as it highlights both the low level of recall (39%) and the even lower understanding of the implications of the information.\n\nHowever, the phrasing of the final answer could be misleading. While it is true that parents do not fully understand the information, the study does indicate that they can recall their child's weight status (94% recall). Therefore, a more nuanced answer might be that parents recall some information (their child's weight status) but do not fully understand the implications of that information.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would argue that the solution is mostly correct but could benefit from a more nuanced conclusion.

The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS.\nTo receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged \u226565 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged \u226565 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p<0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education.\nDoes government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals?",

This variability may lead to some cases being perceived as less significant, potentially resulting in overlooked diagnoses in less severe cases.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the evidence supports the conclusion that sternal fractures in children are indeed rare and can often be overlooked due to a lack of awareness regarding their occurrence and the mechanisms behind them.\n\nFinal answer: **A** (yes)"

The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion.\nIn this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.\nThe sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm. The thickness tended to decrease with the increase in insertion angle from 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.

Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test.\nFor T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity. For N staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (92%) than MRI and MDCT (69 and 73%; p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). MDCT showed better specificity (81%) than EUS and MRI (58 and 73%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.15).\nPreoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer: is there a place for magnetic resonance imaging?",

As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions.\nThis study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden.\nThe Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.\nThe Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001).\nDo Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms?",

The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up.\nTreatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?",

In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment.

However, there are several critical points to consider that may affect the correctness of the conclusion drawn.\n\n1. **Objective of the Study**: The study's objective is clearly stated, focusing on the safety and effectiveness of a scrotal approach for managing contralateral hydrocele during surgery for neonatal testicular torsion.\n\n2. **Patient Data**: The sample size of 37 patients is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. While the average age of presentation and the distribution of left versus right-sided pathology are noted, the small sample size raises questions about the robustness of the conclusions.\n\n3. **Surgical Approach**: The decision to avoid inguinal exploration to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord is a valid concern. However, the lack of exploration for a patent process vaginalis could be seen as a limitation. A patent process vaginalis could lead to future complications, and not addressing it might overlook a potential risk factor for hernia development.\n\n4. **Follow-Up Results**: The follow-up period of 7.5 years without any reported clinical hydrocele or hernia is promising. However, the absence of complications in this cohort does not definitively prove that the scrotal approach is universally safe and effective. It is possible that complications could arise later or in a different population.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that \"less is more\" is based on the observed outcomes in this specific cohort. While the results are encouraging, they do not account for the potential risks associated with not exploring the inguinal canal. The study does not provide a comparison group that underwent inguinal exploration, which would be necessary to draw stronger conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of the scrotal approach.\n\nIn summary, while the study presents interesting findings, the small sample size, lack of exploration for a patent process vaginalis, and absence of a comparative group limit the strength of the conclusion. Therefore, I am more than 95 percent confident that the solution is incorrect.\n\n**Return False**: The conclusion that the scrotal approach is definitively safe and effective is not fully supported by the study's design and findings. Further research with larger sample sizes and comparative analyses is needed to validate these results.",

A significant number of patients (22 out of 37) presented with a contralateral hydrocele.\n\n3. **Surgical Approach**: All hydroceles were treated through a scrotal approach, and no inguinal exploration was performed to check for a patent process vaginalis. This approach was chosen to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord.\n\n4. **Follow-Up Results**: After an average follow-up of 7.5 years, none of the patients who had a contralateral hydrocele developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia. This indicates that the scrotal approach was effective in managing the hydrocele without leading to further complications.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The results suggest that managing contralateral hydrocele through a scrotal approach is both safe and effective, as it did not lead to any adverse outcomes in the long term.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question \"Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?\" is:\n\n**A (yes)**."

The aim was to evaluate their pertinence.\nNineteen patients who received image-guided brachytherapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy were included. Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were analysed.\nMean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, respectively, 2.23 \u00b1 1.4, 6.39 \u00b1 6.6, and 31.85 \u00b1 36.06 Gy. Significant differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered dose was decreased by 1.43 \u00b1 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95.

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity.\nIs adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders?",

        "question": "This study sought to investigate the ischemic and bleeding outcomes of patients fulfilling high bleeding risk (HBR) criteria who were randomized to zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint stent (E-ZES) or bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation followed by an abbreviated dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration for stable or unstable coronary artery disease.\nDES instead of BMS use remains controversial in HBR patients, in whom long-term DAPT poses safety concerns.\nThe ZEUS (Zotarolimus-Eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent in Uncertain DES Candidates) is a multinational, randomized single-blinded trial that randomized among others, in a stratified manner, 828 patients fulfilling pre-defined clinical or biochemical HBR criteria-including advanced age, indication to oral anticoagulants or other pro-hemorrhagic medications, history of bleeding and known anemia-to receive E-ZES or BMS followed by a protocol-mandated 30-day DAPT regimen. The primary endpoint of the study was the 12-month major adverse cardiovascular event rate, consisting of death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.\nCompared with patients without, those with 1 or more HBR criteria had worse outcomes, owing to higher ischemic and bleeding risks. Among HBR patients, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 22.6% of the E-ZES and 29% of the BMS patients (hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.98; p = 0.033), driven by lower myocardial infarction (3.5% vs. 10.4%; p<0.001) and target vessel revascularization (5.9% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.005) rates in the E-ZES arm.

In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent.\n\"Occult\" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy?",

MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.",

Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of labour.\n20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm.\nA median of 3 gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p<0.05).

Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Objective Measures of Cognition**: The study found that the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale was not related to objective measures of attention and verbal memory. This is a critical point because it directly addresses the question of whether the subscale identifies cognitive impairments. The lack of correlation suggests that obsessive-compulsive symptoms do not serve as indicators of cognitive dysfunction as measured by standardized neuropsychological tests.\n\n2. **Correlation with Other Symptoms**: The significant correlations with depression, anxiety, and subjective memory complaints indicate that while there is a relationship between these factors and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, it does not imply that the SCL 90-R subscale is identifying cognitive impairments. Instead, it suggests that the symptoms may be more reflective of emotional or psychological states rather than cognitive deficits.\n\n3. **Multivariate Analysis**: The analysis showing that depression accounted for a substantial portion of the variance in obsessive-compulsive scores further supports the conclusion that these symptoms are more closely tied to mood disorders. The additional contribution of anxiety, while notable, is still relatively small compared to depression. This reinforces the idea that the obsessive-compulsive symptoms are likely manifestations of underlying mood issues rather than direct indicators of cognitive impairment.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The final conclusion drawn in the solution is consistent with the findings of the study. Since the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale did not correlate with objective cognitive measures and was primarily associated with mood and anxiety symptoms, it does not identify cognitive impairments.\n\nGiven this thorough analysis, the solution is indeed correct. Therefore, I would return **True** and affirm that the reasoning is sound and aligns with the findings of the study. The final answer is appropriately concluded as **B** (no).",

                "revised_response": "To determine whether the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale identifies cognitive impairments, we will analyze the findings presented in the study step by step.\n\n1. **Objective Measures of Cognition**: The study utilized a neuropsychological test battery, which included the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, and Trail Making Test B, to assess cognitive functions. The results indicated that the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale was not related to these objective measures of attention and verbal memory. This suggests that the obsessive-compulsive symptoms do not correlate with cognitive impairments as measured by these tests.\n\n2. **Correlation with Other Symptoms**: The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale showed significant correlations with symptoms of depression (r = .81), anxiety (r = .66), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = .75). While these correlations indicate a relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and other psychological factors, they do not imply that the SCL 90-R identifies cognitive impairments. Instead, it suggests that individuals with higher obsessive-compulsive symptoms may also experience higher levels of depression and anxiety, as well as subjective memory complaints.\n\n3. **Multivariate Analysis**: The multivariate analyses indicated that symptoms of depression accounted for 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive scores, with anxiety contributing an additional 6%. This finding reinforces the idea that the obsessive-compulsive symptoms are more closely related to mood and anxiety disorders rather than cognitive impairments. The significant contribution of depression to the variance suggests that the obsessive-compulsive symptoms may be a reflection of underlying mood issues rather than direct indicators of cognitive dysfunction.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale did not correlate with objective measures of cognition and was primarily associated with mood and anxiety symptoms, it does not identify cognitive impairments.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n**B** (no)"
