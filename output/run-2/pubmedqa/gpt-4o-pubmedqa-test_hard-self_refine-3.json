Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study.\nBecause the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure.\nArticles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm.

It is intended to be a marker of physiological impairment.\n\n2. **Study Design**: The study is an inception cohort study conducted at a secondary referral center, involving 85 consecutive emergency surgical patients admitted to the surgical ICU in 1999.\n\n3. **APACHE II Score Calculation**: The score was calculated at multiple time points: before surgery, after admission to the ICU, and on postoperative days 3, 7, and 10.\n\n4. **Findings**:\n   - The APACHE II score at ICU admission (24.2 +/- 8.3) was significantly higher than the initial score (17.8 +/- 7.7), indicating a change due to treatment or other factors.\n   - The predicted mortality based on the initial APACHE II score (34%) was close to the observed mortality (32%), suggesting initial score reliability.\n   - However, the predicted mortality based on the ICU admission score (50%) was significantly different from the observed mortality (32%), indicating potential bias or unreliability at this stage.\n   - In long-term patients (>/=10 days in ICU), the APACHE II scores of survivors and non-survivors were significantly different on day 10, suggesting some predictive value at this point.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The APACHE II score is influenced by treatment effects and may not reliably predict mortality at all stages, particularly at ICU admission. While it shows some predictive value initially and at later stages, the discrepancies suggest it may not be a fully reliable marker of physiological impairment throughout the ICU stay.\n\nBased on this analysis, the APACHE II score is not consistently reliable as a marker of physiological impairment due to its dependency on treatment effects and variability in predictive accuracy.\n\nFinal Answer: (B) no"

From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (<or = 6 or>6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (<or = 10 or>10 IU/L) and maternal age (<or = 35 or>35 years).\nThe clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle>or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively).\nAntral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH?",

T virus-DNA was present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Demographic and clinical features, including stage and grade of liver histology, were comparable between hepatitis G virus-infected and uninfected subjects. Severe liver damage [chronic hepatitis with fibrosis or cirrhosis) were significantly more frequent in subjects with hepatitis C virus liver disease.\nAre hepatitis G virus and TT virus involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease?",
        "answer": "no",
        "answer_rationale": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus.

Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures.\nWe searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).\nUnlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining.

An early newborn discharge was defined as a discharge between 24 and 47 hours of age. Metabolic screening tests included phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Early discharge and traditional stay infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the timing of the first adequate specimen.\nThe state laboratory received specimens from 3860 infants; 1324 were on early discharge newborns and 2536 infants in the traditional stay group. At least one filter paper test (PKU, hypothyroidism, and CAH) was collected on 99.2% of early discharge infants and 96.0% of traditional stay infants (P<.0001). Early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared with traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001) but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 75.3% traditional stay, P=.002). The early discharge group was more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life (1001, 98.8% early discharge vs 2016, 96.7% traditional stay, P=.0005).\nDoes early discharge with nurse home visits affect adequacy of newborn metabolic screening?",

From this pool of 1,003 examinations, 994 were included in our study. Examinations showing at least one polyp or carcinoma 5 mm or larger were considered to have positive results. For combined readings, results were considered positive if either of the two interpreters reported finding a polyp or carcinoma. A McNemar test was used to compare the first reader's results with the combined results of the first and second readers. Results were retrospectively correlated with endoscopic or surgical results in 360 patients, and agreement between first and combined readings and endoscopic results was determined.\nAdding a second reader increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315 (p<0.0001) and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%). Sensitivity of the first and combined readings for detection of all lesions was identical, 76.3% (95% CI, 65.4-87.1%). Specificity decreased from 91.0% (95% CI, 87.9-94.3%) for the first reading to 86.4% (95% CI, 82.2-90.0%) for the combined reading. The overall measurement of agreement decreased from a kappa value of 61.8 (95% CI, 51.2-72.4%) for the first reading to 52.9 (95% CI, 42.2-63.6%) for the combined reading.

The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The importance and interactions of each factor were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and constructing graphs.\nThe concept of breaching confidentiality to protect a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability. A cluster analysis showed groups of lay participants who found breaching confidentiality \"always acceptable\" (n = 14), \"depending on the many circumstances\" (n = 87), requiring \"consultation with an expert\" (n = 30) and \"never acceptable (n = 13)\".\nDo French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease?",

Additionally, a bootstrap validation technique was used to assess the stability of the outcomes.\n\n4. **Results of Multivariate Analysis**: The final multivariate Cox regression model identified four independent prognostic factors for survival:\n   - Male gender with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32\n   - Performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) with HR = 1.63\n   - Patient's self-reported score of pain with HR = 1.11\n   - Dysphagia with HR = 1.12\n\n5. **Interpretation of Results**: The patient's self-reported score of pain and dysphagia were retained as independent prognostic factors in the multivariate model. Specifically, a 10-point shift worse in the scale measuring pain and dysphagia translated into an 11% and 12% increased likelihood of death, respectively.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the patient's self-reported scores of pain and dysphagia, which are components of HRQOL, were found to be independent prognostic factors for survival, it can be concluded that a patient's self-reported HRQOL is indeed a prognostic factor for survival in NSCLC patients.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n(A) yes"

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\nMidwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",

The recurrence sites were the operative scar and chest wall.\n\n4. **Factors Associated with Increased Risk**: Factors associated with increased risk of local failure included age \u2264 40 years and tumor size greater than 20mm. However, these factors did not reach statistical significance.\n\n5. **Implication of Findings**: The recurrence sites being the operative scar and chest wall suggest that these areas are at risk for local failure despite the irradiation of the internal mammary chain. This indicates that the current treatment protocol may not sufficiently cover potential sites of recurrence.\n\n6. **Consideration of Chest Wall Irradiation**: Given that recurrences occurred at the chest wall, it suggests that including chest wall irradiation might help reduce the risk of local failure. However, the study does not provide statistical significance for the associated risk factors, which means the evidence is not strong enough to definitively conclude that chest wall irradiation should be included.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: While the recurrence at the chest wall suggests potential benefits of including chest wall irradiation, the lack of statistical significance in the associated risk factors means the decision is not clear-cut.

        "question": "Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1.\nDoes the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?",

Specifically, ET-1 levels decrease in patients experiencing hypotension and increase in those experiencing rebound hypertension. This suggests that ET-1 may play a role in these hemodynamic changes.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n(A) yes",

We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients.\nNinety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.\nThe calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000).

A normal or bulging disc with HIZ was not associated with reproduction of pain. Disc degeneration (sensitivity 95.4%; specificity 38.8%; PPV 33.9%), disc protrusion (sensitivity 68.2%; specificity 80.6%; PPV 53.6%), and HIZ (sensitivity 56.8%; specificity 83.6%; PPV 53.2%) were not helpful in the identification of a disc with concordant pain.\nCan magnetic resonance imaging accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection?",

This further supports the idea that experts do not view IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion, as they do not feel the need to rule out other conditions extensively.\n   - **Beliefs Impact on Testing**: Providers who believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion order more tests and spend more money, indicating a tendency to rule out other conditions before diagnosing IBS.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The guidelines and expert behavior suggest that IBS should be diagnosed positively using the Rome criteria, without the need to exclude other conditions first. The survey results show a clear distinction between experts and nonexperts, with experts aligning with the guidelines.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) no"

Thirty-four subjects (mean age 55 years, body mass index 34 kg/m 2 , fasting triglycerides 3.5 mmol/L) with diagnosed sleep apnoea syndrome not treated with continuous positive airways pressure were enrolled and randomized to once daily treatment with fenofibrate (145 mg NanoCrystal(R) tablet) or placebo. Overnight polysomnography, computerized attention/vigilance tests and blood sampling for measurement of lipids, insulin, fasting plasma glucose and fibrinogen were performed at the end of each study period.\nNCT00816829.\nAs this was an exploratory study, a range of sleep variables were evaluated. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and percentage of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2))<90% were relevant as they have been evaluated in other clinical trials. Other variables included total apnoeas, hypopnoeas and oxygen desaturations, and non-cortical micro-awakenings related to respiratory events per hour.\nFenofibrate treatment significantly reduced the percentage of time with SpO(2)<90% (from 9.0% to 3.5% vs. 10.0% to 11.5% with placebo, p = 0.007), although there was no significant change in the AHI (reduction vs. control 14% (95%CI -47 to 40%, p = 0.533). Treatment reduced obstructive apnoeas (by 44%, from 18.5 at baseline to 15.0 at end of treatment vs. 29.0 to 30.5 on placebo, p = 0.048), and non-cortical micro-awakenings per hour (from 23.5 to 18.0 vs. 24.0 to 25.0 with placebo, p = 0.004).

                "revised_response": "To determine whether temperature should be monitored during kidney allograft preservation, let's analyze the information provided step by step:\n\n1. **Importance of Temperature Control**: It is generally considered that kidney grafts should be preserved at 4 degrees C during cold storage. This indicates that maintaining a specific temperature is crucial for the preservation process to ensure the viability and functionality of the grafts.\n\n2. **Study Setup**: The study involved monitoring temperature using the Thermobouton probe during the preservation of pig kidneys, mimicking conditions used for human grafts. This suggests that the study aimed to ensure the preservation conditions are optimal and consistent, which is essential for successful transplantation outcomes.\n\n3. **Comparison of Storage Cans**: The study compared the new Biotainer storage can with the former storage can. The new storage can maintained the lowest temperature for 15 hours and kept the temperature below 5 degrees C for 57 hours. In contrast, the former storage can maintained the lowest temperature for only 80 minutes and reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. This comparison highlights the importance of monitoring temperature to evaluate and choose the best storage method, as different storage solutions can significantly impact the preservation duration and effectiveness.\n\n4. **Probe Position and Ice Amount**: The study found that temperature levels were the same regardless of the probe's position within the transport pack and were similar when using 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice. This suggests that while the position of the probe and the amount of ice may not significantly affect temperature levels, monitoring is still necessary to ensure consistency and reliability in maintaining the desired temperature range.\n\n5. **Human Graft Monitoring**: Similar results were observed when monitoring the conservation of human grafts, indicating that the findings from pig kidneys are applicable to human grafts. This reinforces the relevance of the study's results to actual clinical practice.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the importance of maintaining a specific temperature for kidney graft preservation and the variability observed between different storage methods, monitoring temperature is crucial to ensure optimal preservation conditions are met consistently. This helps in making informed decisions about storage solutions and maintaining the quality of the grafts.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n(A) Yes, temperature should be monitored during kidney allograft preservation."

Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.

There are three case reports of fondaparinux being used as perioperative bridge therapy, with varying doses (2.5 mg and 7.5 mg).\n\n4. **Anesthesia Guidelines**: Professional anesthesia guidelines conflict regarding the timing of fondaparinux administration with neuraxial catheter use, adding to the complexity of its perioperative use.\n\n5. **Alternative Anticoagulants**: In situations where low-molecular-weight heparin or i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, contraindicated, or has limited efficacy (e.g., heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency), fondaparinux may be considered as an alternative.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- Fondaparinux is not ideal for perioperative bridging due to its long half-life and the lack of clear guidelines.\n- However, in specific cases where other anticoagulants are contraindicated or ineffective, fondaparinux might be used as a bridging agent.\n\nTherefore, while fondaparinux is not generally recommended for perioperative bridging, it may have a role in certain situations where other options are not viable.\n\nFinal Answer: (C) maybe"

        "question": "Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients.\nThis is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy.\nThe Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold.\nDoes combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?",

Here's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Survey Results on CT Ordering**:\n   - The solution correctly noted that 90% of residents did not change the number of CT scans ordered, indicating that the lecture did not significantly alter ordering patterns in terms of quantity. This is a key observation that supports the conclusion that the intervention did not have a strong impact on reducing CT scan orders.\n\n2. **Use of Alternative Imaging Modalities**:\n   - The solution highlighted the increase in alternative imaging modalities, with 33% of residents reporting increased use. This suggests that while the number of CT scans ordered remained largely unchanged, some residents were considering other imaging options, which could indicate a shift in practice.\n\n3. **Patient Education**:\n   - The solution correctly pointed out that a significant portion of residents engaged with patients about radiation exposure, using the lecture information. This aspect of the study shows that the education had some impact on patient interaction, which is an important factor in clinical practice.\n\n4. **Interest from Referring Physicians**:\n   - The solution noted the interest from other physician groups, which suggests that the topic of radiation education is valued and could influence future practices. This is an important observation that supports the potential for broader impact beyond the immediate study group.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe solution concluded with a \"maybe,\" reflecting the mixed results of the study. This is appropriate given the data: while there was no significant decrease in CT scan orders, there were changes in imaging practices and interest from other physicians, indicating potential for future impact.\n\nOverall, the solution accurately interpreted the study results and provided a balanced conclusion.

We determined the agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 6.0\u00a0mm.\nThe mean (\u00b1standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 \u00b1 0.70\u00a0mm with SLBM and 6.26 \u00b1 0.68\u00a0mm with CIP (p\u2009=\u20090.01) averaging both examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60\u00a0mm and -0.30\u00a0mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30\u00a0mm. The ICCs were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09\u00a0mm. Kappa statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity ranged from 5.4\u00a0mm to 6.2\u00a0mm.\nCan we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method?",

A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC.

        "question": "Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.\nAre women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?",

(3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects.\nDuring the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p<0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5\u00b11.4 before to 4.1\u00b11.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12\u00b11.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76\u00b10.79 after (p<0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after).

This suggests that there is a pattern to where violent incidents occur, which can be targeted for intervention.\n\n2. **Interagency Hotspots**: There is a significant overlap between police and ambulance hotspots, with 25% of police hotspots and 15% of ambulance hotspots overlapping across agencies. This overlap indicates that there is potential for interagency collaboration to address violence in these areas.\n\n3. **Statistical Correlation**: The datasets from police and ambulance services are statistically correlated at levels of 0.57 and 0.34. This correlation suggests that there is a relationship between the data collected by both agencies, which could be leveraged to gain a more comprehensive understanding of community violence.\n\n4. **Incident Overlap**: The study finds that 50% of police hotspots do not overlap with ambulance hotspots, indicating that half of the assault concentrations are unknown to the police. This suggests that ambulance data could provide additional insights into areas of violence that are not currently being addressed by police data alone.\n\n5. **Severity of Injuries**: The data suggests that more severely injured patients tend to be found in areas with the highest number of police-recorded crimes.

Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.\nSchanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases.

However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between OTC syringe sales and crime.\nWe used a geographic information system and novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling pharmacies.\nBy December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts. Using generalized estimating equations and adjusting for potential confounders, reported crime rates were negatively associated with OTC syringe sales (adjusted rate ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.81, 0.99).\nIs crime associated with over-the-counter pharmacy syringe sales?",

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management.\nA prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit.\nA total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p<0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most (58%) did not receive medical clearance.

We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.\nRandomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.\nParticipants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.\n1093 children aged 4-8\u2005years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40\u2005min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2\u2005weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.\nInterviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.\nOverall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92).

The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion.\nIn this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.\nThe sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm.

        "question": "Among patients with acute stroke symptoms, delay in hospital admission is the main obstacle for the use of thrombolytic therapy and other interventions associated with decreased mortality and disability. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire.\nWe performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (\u226560 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at \u226575%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression.\nAmong 367 elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21).\nDo elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke?",

Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification.

As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions.\nThis study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden.\nThe Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.\nThe Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001).\nDo Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms?",

        "question": "Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up.\nTreatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?",

Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.",

The aim was to evaluate their pertinence.\nNineteen patients who received image-guided brachytherapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy were included. Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were analysed.\nMean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, respectively, 2.23 \u00b1 1.4, 6.39 \u00b1 6.6, and 31.85 \u00b1 36.06 Gy. Significant differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered dose was decreased by 1.43 \u00b1 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95.

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor.

This suggests that without adjustment, the analysis might misrepresent the true relationships due to differences in how individuals report their sleep problems.\n\nBased on these steps, adjustment for reporting heterogeneity appears necessary to accurately identify factors associated with sleep disorders. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n(A) yes"

        "question": "In this single-centre prospective study, triage nurses estimated the probability of admission using a 100\u2005mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and GAPS was generated automatically from triage data. We compared calibration using rank sum tests, discrimination using area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and accuracy with McNemar's test.\nOf 1829 attendances, 745 (40.7%) were admitted, not significantly different from GAPS' prediction of 750 (41.0%, p=0.678). In contrast, the nurses' mean VAS predicted 865 admissions (47.3%), overestimating by 6.6% (p<0.0001). GAPS discriminated between admission and discharge as well as nurses, its AUC 0.876 compared with 0.875 for VAS (p=0.93). As a binary predictor, its accuracy was 80.6%, again comparable with VAS (79.0%), p=0.18. In the minority of attendances, when nurses felt at least 95% certain of the outcome, VAS' accuracy was excellent, at 92.4%. However, in the remaining majority, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration (+1.2% vs +9.2%, p<0.0001), discrimination (AUC 0.810 vs 0.759, p=0.001) and accuracy (75.1% vs 68.9%, p=0.0009). When we used GAPS, but 'over-ruled' it when clinical certainty was \u226595%, this significantly outperformed either method, with AUC 0.891 (0.877-0.907) and accuracy 82.5% (80.7%-84.2%).\nPredicting admission at triage: are nurses better than a simple objective score?",

The study included cases with no known cause of misty mesentery according to associated CT findings, clinical history, or biochemical manifestations, and excluded patients with diseases known to cause misty mesentery, lymph nodes greater than a short-axis diameter of 5\u00a0mm, discrete mesenteric masses, or bowel wall thickening.\nThere were a total of 561 patients in whom misty mesentery appearance was depicted on abdominopelvic CT scans. A total of 80 cases were found to have isolated incidental idiopathic misty mesentery, giving a prevalence of 7%. The common indication for CT examination was abdominal pain.

Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography.\nWe retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression.\nWe identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%.

Here's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Study Design**: The study design is accurately described, with two groups of women receiving different treatments during elective abortion.\n\n2. **Gemeprost Administration**: Both groups received a median of 3 applications, which is correctly noted.\n\n3. **Induction to Abortion Interval**: The solution correctly identifies that the median induction to abortion interval was shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group but not significantly so.\n\n4. **Intervals from Last Application of Prostaglandin to Abortion and from 3 cm Cervical Dilatation to Abortion**: The solution accurately notes that these intervals were slightly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group but not significantly.\n\n5. **Requirement of Butylscopolamine**: The solution correctly points out that the requirement was higher in the paracervical anaesthesia group, which is statistically significant (p<0.05).\n\n6. **Requirement of Pethidin and Pain Intensity**: The solution correctly states that there was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of Pethidin requirement and pain intensity.\n\n7. **Side Effects**: The solution correctly notes that no side effects of paracervical anaesthesia were reported.\n\n**Conclusion**: The solution concludes that the para-cervical block does not offer significant additional advantages, which is consistent with the study's findings. The higher requirement for Butylscopolamine could be seen as a disadvantage, and the lack of significant improvement in key outcomes supports the conclusion.\n\nOverall, the solution is correct in its analysis and conclusion based on the study's data.",

                "revised_response": "To determine whether para-cervical block offers additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester, we need to analyze the results of the study step by step:\n\n1. **Study Design**: The study involved 20 women undergoing elective abortion between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation. They were divided into two groups: one received only Pethidin and Butylscopolamine, while the other group additionally received paracervical anaesthesia.\n\n2. **Gemeprost Administration**: Both groups received a median of 3 gemeprost applications.\n\n3. **Induction to Abortion Interval**: \n   - Without paracervical anaesthesia: median interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours).\n   - With paracervical anaesthesia: median interval was 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours).\n   - The interval was slightly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group, but not significantly so.\n\n4. **Intervals from Last Application of Prostaglandin to Abortion and from 3 cm Cervical Dilatation to Abortion**: These intervals were slightly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group, but again, not significantly.\n\n5. **Requirement of Butylscopolamine**: Higher in the paracervical anaesthesia group (p<0.05), indicating increased need for this medication.\n\n6. **Requirement of Pethidin and Pain Intensity**: No statistical difference between the two groups, especially in the late first stage of labour.\n\n7. **Side Effects**: No side effects of paracervical anaesthesia were reported.\n\n**Conclusion**: \n- The para-cervical block did not significantly reduce the induction to abortion interval or the pain intensity compared to the group without it.\n- It did result in a higher requirement for Butylscopolamine, which could be seen as a disadvantage.\n- No side effects were reported, which is positive, but the lack of significant improvement in key outcomes suggests limited additional advantages.\n\nBased on this analysis, the para-cervical block does not offer significant additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester.\n\nFinal Answer: (B) no"
