They were also tested for bilateral and unilateral leg extensor muscle concentric power output by an isokinetic squat and reactive strength by a drop jump.\nThe correlations between concentric power and straight sprinting speed were non-significant whereas the relationships between reactive strength and straight speed were statistically significant. Correlations between muscle power and speed while changing direction were generally low and non-significant for concentric leg power with some moderate and significant (p<0.05) coefficients found for reactive strength. The participants who turned faster to one side tended to have a reactive strength dominance in the leg responsible for the push-off action.\nIs muscle power related to running speed with changes of direction?",
        "answer": "yes",
        "answer_rationale": "The relationships between leg muscle power and change-of-direction speed were not consistent. Reactive strength as measured by the drop jump appears to have some importance for lateral change-of-direction speed, possibly because of similar push-off actions. It was concluded that reactive strength of the leg extensor muscles has some importance in change-of-direction performance but the other technical and perceptual factors than influence agility performance should also be considered.",

Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures.\nWe searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).\nUnlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining.

However, the presence of Bcl-2 in some neurons and reactive astroglia indicates that not all neurons are undergoing apoptosis.\n\n2. **Caspase Activity**: The detection of fractin, which indicates caspase activity, in approximately 10% of neurons suggests that some neurons may be undergoing apoptosis. However, this is a small percentage, and the overall implication is that not all neuronal death is due to apoptosis.\n\n3. **TUNEL Staining**: The lack of DNA fragmentation as evidenced by TUNEL staining is a critical point. TUNEL is a method specifically used to detect DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis. The absence of TUNEL positivity suggests that the majority of neuronal death is not apoptotic.\n\n4. **Nuclear Morphology**: The inability to detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology further supports the conclusion that the cell death observed is not primarily apoptotic.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence suggests that while there may be some apoptotic processes occurring in a small subset of neurons, the predominant mechanism of cell death in MTS does not appear to be apoptosis.

This indicates that the second reader may not always agree with the first reader, which could complicate interpretations.\n\n5. **Detection of Adenocarcinomas**: The sensitivity for detecting adenocarcinomas was reported to be 100%, which is a strong argument for the necessity of double reading, especially for serious conditions.\n\nGiven these points, the study suggests that double reading is beneficial in increasing the detection of lesions and potentially altering treatment plans, despite some decrease in specificity and agreement.

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\nMidwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",

The results indicate that:\n\n1. **Competence in Specific Skills**: Rural midwives reported higher competence in breech delivery, while urban midwives reported higher competence in skills like intravenous fluid replacement and newborn examinations. This suggests that the type of competencies that midwives feel confident in may vary based on their working environment.\n\n2. **Continuing Professional Development**: Both groups faced barriers to continuing education, but rural midwives had a higher attendance at educational events recently, indicating a proactive approach to maintaining their skills despite geographical challenges.\n\n3. **Barriers to Development**: Urban midwives reported lack of time as a greater barrier, while rural midwives faced challenges related to distance to training. Additionally, urban midwives showed a higher lack of motivation or interest.\n\nGiven these points, it can be inferred that working in a rural location does indeed affect midwives' competence in certain areas, as evidenced by the differences in reported competencies and the barriers faced by each group.

However, children with a history of hearing loss or current hearing issues showed significant improvement in reading abilities from the specialized training.\n\n2. **Key Findings**: \n   - The specialized training program had a notable benefit for children with hearing loss, suggesting that this group may require targeted interventions to support their reading development.\n   - For the general population of preschool children, the study did not find significant differences in writing abilities between the two training modalities.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The results indicate that while specialized training in phonological awareness is beneficial for certain children (specifically those with hearing issues), it does not show a clear advantage for all preschool children. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that such training is indicated for every preschool child.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer to the question is (B) no, as the evidence suggests that not all preschool children would benefit from specialized phonological awareness training.\n\nNow, reviewing the solutions provided:\n- All five solutions consistently selected (B) as the answer.\n\nThus, the most consistent solution across all evaluations is (B).\n\nFinal answer: B",

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1.\nDoes the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?",

        "question": "Assessing the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients consists of periodical clinical evaluations and laboratory tests. We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients.\nNinety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.\nThe calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02).\nCan calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?",

We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers.\nWe developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.\nExperts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001).

Specifically, the reduction was from 9.0% to 3.5% compared to a slight increase in the placebo group. Additionally, fenofibrate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in obstructive apnoeas and non-cortical micro-awakenings per hour, which are also important factors in the management of sleep apnoea.\n\nHowever, the study did not find a significant change in the apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI), which is a critical measure for assessing the severity of sleep apnoea. The lack of significant change in AHI could suggest that while fenofibrate may have some beneficial effects on certain aspects of sleep apnoea, it does not significantly alter the overall severity as measured by AHI.\n\nGiven that the study is exploratory and has limitations (such as a small sample size, limited treatment duration, and lack of correction for multiplicity of testing), the conclusion about fenofibrate's role in sleep apnoea syndrome is not definitive. The results suggest potential benefits, but they do not establish a clear therapeutic role.\n\nConsidering the options:\n- (A) yes: This would imply a definitive role for fenofibrate in treating sleep apnoea, which the study does not conclusively support.\n- (B) no: This would imply that fenofibrate has no role, which is also not entirely accurate given the observed benefits.\n- (C) maybe: This reflects the uncertainty and the exploratory nature of the study, acknowledging that there may be some benefits without establishing a clear role.\n\nThe solutions provided all consistently choose (A) yes, which suggests a belief in the potential role of fenofibrate based on the observed reductions in certain indices.

Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold.\nDoes combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?",

The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was reported as 0.085, but this difference was not statistically significant.

        "question": "A higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in HIV-infected patients, together with chronic infection and treatments, has resulted in an increased risk of silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI). The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease.\nThe prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment.\nCoronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs. In this subpopulation of 47 patients, the prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT reached 19.2 %.\nShould HIV-infected patients be screened for silent myocardial ischaemia using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT?",

The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.\nA total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively.

        "question": "Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.\nAre women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?",

Furthermore, it highlights that more severely injured patients tend to be in areas with high police-recorded crimes.\n\nGiven this context, the solutions provided all consistently indicate \"A\" (yes) as the answer to whether ambulance data can contribute to the reduction of community violence. This consistency across all five solutions suggests a strong agreement that the data collected by ambulances can indeed play a role in understanding and potentially mitigating violence in communities.\n\nIn conclusion, the repeated answer of \"A\" across all solutions indicates a consensus that the integration of ambulance data with police data can enhance the understanding of violence hotspots and inform strategies to reduce community violence.\n\nThus, the most consistent solution is:\n\nA",

Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.\nSchanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology (p>0.8).\nIs portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments?",

However, it also states that ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Additionally, the interobserver repeatability analysis shows that all examiners had consistent measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology.\n\nGiven these findings, we can infer the following:\n\n1. **Accuracy of Ultrasonography**: While the study shows that ultrasonography underestimates the measurements, it still provides a good correlation with actual values in a specific range (5 to 12 mm). This suggests that while it may not be perfectly accurate, it can still be useful in certain contexts.\n\n2. **Interobserver Repeatability**: The fact that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements indicates that the method can be reliably used by different operators, which is a positive aspect for its application in austere environments.\n\n3. **Context of Use**: The question specifically asks about the accuracy of ultrasonography in austere environments. Given that the study shows that ultrasonography can provide useful information, albeit with some underestimation, it suggests that it may still be a viable option for evaluating Schanz pin placement.\n\nConsidering these points, the answer to whether portable ultrasonography is accurate in this context is nuanced.

Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40\u2005min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2\u2005weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.\nInterviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.\nOverall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant.

The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS.\nTo receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged \u226565 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged \u226565 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p<0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education.\nDoes government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals?",

Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test.\nFor T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity. For N staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (92%) than MRI and MDCT (69 and 73%; p = 0.01 and p = 0.02).

As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions.\nThis study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden.\nThe Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.\nThe Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001).\nDo Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms?",

The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis.

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity.\nIs adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders?",

In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent.\n\"Occult\" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy?",
        "answer": "yes",
        "answer_rationale": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.",

Both MRI and arthroscopy were performed to identify injuries that were not visible on standard X-rays.\n\nKey findings from the study include:\n- MRI identified three types of occult injuries: bone bruises, subchondral injuries, and osteochondral injuries.\n- Arthroscopy was able to depict a higher number of osteochondral and chondral injuries compared to MRI.\n- The study suggests that while MRI can identify certain types of injuries, arthroscopy is more definitive in visualizing and diagnosing these injuries.\n\nGiven that arthroscopy was able to identify more injuries than MRI, it indicates that MRI cannot fully substitute for arthroscopy in this context. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether MRI can replace arthroscopy is \"no.\"\n\nThe solutions provided all consistently selected option B, which corresponds to \"no.\" This consistency across all solutions indicates a strong agreement on the conclusion drawn from the study's findings.\n\nThus, the most consistent solution is:\n\nB",

        "question": "Uterus-specific synthetic Prostaglandin analogues (gemeprost, sulproston etc.) have been widely employed for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of labour.\n20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm.\nA median of 3 gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p<0.05). The requirement of Pethidin and the intensity of pain (measured by pain scale according to Huskisson) especially in the late first stage of labour were not statistically different between both groups. Side effects of paracervical anaesthesia did not occur.\nDoes para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?",

However, this difference was not statistically significant (NS).\n   - The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group, but again, these differences were not statistically significant.\n   - The requirement for Butylscopolamine was higher in the paracervical anaesthesia group (p<0.05), indicating that more medication was needed for this group.\n   - The requirement of Pethidin and the intensity of pain were not statistically different between the two groups, suggesting that pain management was similar regardless of the use of paracervical anaesthesia.\n   - Importantly, there were no side effects reported from the paracervical anaesthesia.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The results indicate that while there were some differences in the induction to abortion interval and medication requirements, these were not statistically significant. The pain levels and Pethidin requirements were similar in both groups, suggesting that paracervical anaesthesia did not provide a clear advantage in terms of pain relief or the speed of abortion induction.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer to the question of whether para-cervical block offers additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the second trimester is **(B) no**. This is because the study did not demonstrate significant benefits from the use of paracervical anaesthesia in terms of pain management or induction time.\n\nSince all provided solutions consistently indicate \"B,\" this is the most reliable answer.\n\nFinal answer: B",
