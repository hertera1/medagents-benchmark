Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures.\nWe searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).\nUnlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining.

However, the presence of Bcl-2 in some neurons and reactive astroglia indicates that not all neurons are undergoing apoptosis.\n   - **Fractin Immunostaining**: The detection of fractin, which indicates caspase activity, in approximately 10% of neurons suggests that some neurons may be undergoing apoptosis. However, this is not definitive for all neurons.\n   - **TUNEL Staining**: The lack of DNA fragmentation as evidenced by TUNEL staining is a critical finding. TUNEL is a method specifically used to detect DNA fragmentation, which is a hallmark of apoptosis. The absence of this finding suggests that the majority of cell death is not apoptotic.\n   - **Nuclear Morphology**: The study also reports no typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology, which further supports the conclusion that the cell death observed is not consistent with apoptosis.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Given the evidence presented, particularly the lack of DNA fragmentation and typical apoptotic nuclear changes, it is reasonable to conclude that the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis is not apoptotic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n(B) no",

Metabolic screening tests included phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Early discharge and traditional stay infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the timing of the first adequate specimen.\nThe state laboratory received specimens from 3860 infants; 1324 were on early discharge newborns and 2536 infants in the traditional stay group. At least one filter paper test (PKU, hypothyroidism, and CAH) was collected on 99.2% of early discharge infants and 96.0% of traditional stay infants (P<.0001). Early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared with traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001) but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 75.3% traditional stay, P=.002).

While the same positive control cell line (K562) and quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were different.\nThe detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p<0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory.\nBCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR : are correlated results possible from homebrew assays?",

The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The importance and interactions of each factor were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and constructing graphs.\nThe concept of breaching confidentiality to protect a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability.

However, after reanalyzing the data while controlling for age, it was found that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between the groups.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the overall scores were similar, the specific outcomes regarding continence favored the ABD group, while stool patterns favored the TERPT group. The question asks if the long-term results of the transanal pull-through are equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through. Given that there was a significant difference in continence scores, the results are not equal.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n**B** (no)",
        "thinking": "After analyzing the outcomes of the TERPT and ABD procedures for Hirschsprung disease, it was determined that while overall scores are similar, the specific results indicate significant differences in continence and stool pattern favoring the ABD and TERPT procedures respectively. This leads to the conclusion that the long-term results are not equal, thus the answer is 'no'.",

Kidney damage markers (daily proteinuria and tubular enzymes) and renal function (serum creatinine, cystatin C, and creatinine clearances) were assessed on postoperative days 1 and 5 and at 12 mo. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was evaluated before surgery and at 3 mo. Renal scintigraphy was performed before the procedure, at 5 d and at 3 and 12 mo postoperatively. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test and logistic regression analysis.\nIn terms of kidney damage and renal function markers, the statistical analysis demonstrated that at 1 yr there was complete return to the normal range and no statistical difference between the values at the various time points. The GFR was not significantly different before and 3 mo after surgery.

This can lead to renal damage if the ischemia lasts too long.\n\n2. **Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy (LPN)**: LPN is a surgical procedure to remove a portion of the kidney. It is often performed with the intention of preserving as much renal function as possible.\n\n3. **Ischemia Duration**: The question specifies that the patients underwent LPN with warm ischemia times greater than 30 minutes. While prolonged warm ischemia can increase the risk of renal damage, it is not uncommon in surgical practice, especially in complex cases.\n\n4. **Study Findings**: The study indicates that despite the warm ischemia lasting over 30 minutes, the kidney damage markers and renal function returned to normal ranges at 1 year post-surgery. This suggests that the procedure was successful and that the kidneys were able to recover from the ischemic period.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the study involved patients who underwent LPN with warm ischemia times exceeding 30 minutes and that they showed no long-term adverse effects, it is indeed possible to have warm ischemia over 30 minutes during such a procedure.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\n**(A) yes**",

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\nMidwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",

For instance, rural midwives reported higher competence in breech delivery, while urban midwives reported higher competence in intravenous fluid replacement and newborn examinations.\n\n2. **Barriers to Professional Development**: Both groups face barriers to continuing professional development, but the nature of these barriers differs. Rural midwives face challenges related to distance to training, while urban midwives report lack of time as a greater barrier.

The rural midwives may develop certain skills (like breech delivery) due to the nature of their practice, while urban midwives may have more opportunities to practice other skills (like intravenous fluid replacement) due to the higher volume of cases.\n\nBased on this analysis, it can be concluded that working in a rural location does affect midwives' competence, particularly in terms of the specific skills they feel confident in.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A) yes",

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1.\nDoes the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?",

This suggests that the progression or evolution of lesions may not differ significantly between these two groups.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The study indicates that while there are some similarities in the rates of lesions between VAIN and CIN, particularly in terms of mild lesions being more common with mild lesions, the lack of significant differences in the rates of cervical lesions among different grades of VAIN suggests that the evolution of VAIN may not be identical to that of CIN.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia has the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is:\n\n**B** (no)",

We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients.\nNinety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.\nThe calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02).\nCan calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?",

Yet many clinicians are concerned about overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers.\nWe developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.\nExperts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001). Experts only rated celiac sprue screening and complete blood count as appropriate in D-IBS; nonexperts rated most tests as appropriate.

The Rome criteria are a set of diagnostic criteria specifically designed for functional gastrointestinal disorders, including IBS.\n\n2. **Current Guidelines**: The guidelines mentioned in the question emphasize that IBS should not be treated as a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that clinicians should be able to diagnose IBS based on the Rome criteria without needing to rule out other conditions first.\n\n3. **Survey Results**: The survey results indicate that IBS experts are less likely to view IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion compared to non-experts. Specifically, only 8% of experts endorsed IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion, while 72% of non-experts did. This significant difference suggests that experts are more confident in diagnosing IBS based on the Rome criteria alone.\n\n4. **Testing Proclivity**: The survey also shows that experts perform fewer tests and spend less money on testing for IBS compared to non-experts. This further supports the idea that experts do not see the need to exclude other diagnoses before confirming IBS.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the guidelines and the survey findings, it is clear that IBS is not considered a diagnosis of exclusion by experts in the field.

Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.

Most recommendations suggest avoiding its use before surgeries involving neuraxial anesthesia due to the risk of bleeding and complications.\n\n3. **Dosing and Administration**: The trials mentioned used fondaparinux for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, with a common dose of 2.5 mg daily. However, the case reports indicate that higher doses (7.5 mg) were also used, which raises concerns about safety and efficacy in the perioperative context.\n\n4. **Conflicting Guidelines**: There is a conflict in professional anesthesia guidelines regarding the timing of fondaparinux administration, particularly with neuraxial catheters, which adds to the uncertainty of its use.\n\n5. **Special Patient Populations**: The text notes that fondaparinux may be considered for patients who cannot use low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin due to contraindications or limited efficacy, such as those with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While fondaparinux may have a potential role in bridging therapy for specific patient populations where other anticoagulants are not suitable, the general recommendation is to avoid its use before surgery due to the associated risks.

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold.\nDoes combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?",

This diversity allows for the examination of age-related differences.\n\n2. **Key Findings**:\n   - Older adults reported less symptomatology than younger patients.\n   - Younger patients described more personality dysfunction than older patients.\n   - Older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies compared to younger adults.\n   - Personality traits, social supports, gender, and age were found to predict coping strategies.\n   - However, Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom severity were not significant predictors of coping strategies.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Results**: The findings suggest that age plays a significant role in how coping strategies are employed, particularly in relation to personality traits. Since older adults exhibit less dysfunctional coping and less personality dysfunction, it indicates that age may influence the relationship between personality and coping strategies.\n\n4. **Moderation Analysis**: For age to moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style, it would mean that the relationship between personality disorder and coping strategies changes depending on the age of the individual. Given that the study found significant differences in coping strategies and personality dysfunction between younger and older adults, it supports the idea that age does indeed influence this relationship.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients is:\n\n**(A) yes**.",

        "question": "A higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in HIV-infected patients, together with chronic infection and treatments, has resulted in an increased risk of silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI). The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease.\nThe prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment.\nCoronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs. In this subpopulation of 47 patients, the prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT reached 19.2 %.\nShould HIV-infected patients be screened for silent myocardial ischaemia using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT?",

        "question": "Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.\nA total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC\u2009>\u20091 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.002).

        "question": "Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.\nAre women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?",

These datasets are linked to identify women with depression during pregnancy.\n\n2. **Ascertainment Methods**: Women with depression were identified through two methods:\n   - By dispensing records of antidepressants (4.6% of pregnant women).\n   - By hospital admissions with a recorded comorbidity related to depression (3.1% of pregnant women).\n\n3. **Overlap and Identification**: The study found that only 899 pregnancies were identified in both groups, which is 13.6% of all cases.

Furthermore, 80% of women who were dispensed antidepressants did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity in their hospital records.\n\n4. **Implications**: The low overlap and the high percentage of women with antidepressant prescriptions not having a recorded depression comorbidity suggest that while some women with major depression can be identified through dispensing records, many are not captured in hospital admission data. This indicates limitations in the ascertainment of depression in pregnancy using these datasets.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the significant limitations in identifying women with major depression in pregnancy through the available population health data, it can be concluded that while some women are identifiable, many are not.

Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of police-recorded crimes.\nCan routinely collected ambulance data about assaults contribute to reduction in community violence?",

The findings indicate that both police and ambulance service calls are concentrated in specific geographical areas, suggesting that these hotspots are critical for understanding where violence occurs.\n\n3. **Correlation of Datasets**: The study found a statistical correlation between police and ambulance data, indicating that there is some overlap in the locations of violent incidents reported to both agencies. However, it also noted that a significant portion of police hotspots does not overlap with ambulance hotspots, implying that there are incidents of violence that the police may not be aware of.\n\n4. **Implications for Community Violence Reduction**: The data suggests that ambulance data, particularly regarding assaults, can provide valuable insights into areas of high violence that may not be fully captured by police data alone. This could help in identifying and addressing community violence more effectively.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the study indicates a correlation between ambulance data and police data, and that there are areas where ambulance data reveals incidents not known to the police, it stands to reason that routinely collected ambulance data about assaults could indeed contribute to a reduction in community violence by informing police and community interventions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n(A) yes",

Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.\nSchanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range.

Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between OTC syringe sales and crime.\nWe used a geographic information system and novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling pharmacies.\nBy December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts. Using generalized estimating equations and adjusting for potential confounders, reported crime rates were negatively associated with OTC syringe sales (adjusted rate ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.81, 0.99).\nIs crime associated with over-the-counter pharmacy syringe sales?",

The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS.\nTo receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged \u226565 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged \u226565 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p<0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education.\nDoes government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals?",

The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion.\nIn this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.\nThe sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years.

Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test.\nFor T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity.

Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.\nThe Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score.

The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis.

Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were analysed.\nMean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, respectively, 2.23 \u00b1 1.4, 6.39 \u00b1 6.6, and 31.85 \u00b1 36.06 Gy. Significant differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered dose was decreased by 1.43 \u00b1 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019).

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor.

        "raw_response": "To determine whether it is safe to perform rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma, we need to consider the implications of anastomotic leakage and the role of a diverting stoma.\n\n1. **Understanding Anastomotic Leakage**: Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication that can occur after colorectal surgery, particularly after rectal anastomosis. It can lead to significant morbidity, including peritonitis, sepsis, and the need for reoperation.\n\n2. **Role of a Diverting Stoma**: A diverting stoma, such as a loop ileostomy, is often created to divert fecal flow away from the anastomosis. This can help reduce the risk of leakage and its consequences by minimizing the pressure and exposure of the anastomosis to fecal matter.\n\n3. **Study Data**: In the study, 43 major colorectal procedures were performed, with a significant number being low rectal resections. The presence of a diverting stoma was noted in only a small percentage of patients (8% had a diverting loop ileostomy). The study's primary outcome was anastomotic leakage, which is critical in assessing the safety of performing anastomosis without a stoma.\n\n4. **Clinical Considerations**: The decision to perform anastomosis without a diverting stoma typically depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the extent of the cancer, the quality of the tissue, and the surgeon's experience. In many cases, especially in high-risk patients or complex surgeries, a diverting stoma is recommended to mitigate the risk of leakage.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the potential for serious complications associated with anastomotic leakage and the limited use of diverting stomas in the study, it is generally considered safer to perform rectal anastomosis with a diverting stoma in high-risk situations. Therefore, performing rectal anastomosis without a diverting stoma may not be safe.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n(B) no",

This design allows for the assessment of potential associations between exposure and fertility outcomes.\n\n2. **Findings on Exposure**: The study found no differences in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure between the infertile (sterile) and fertile groups. This suggests that simply being exposed to radiation does not differentiate between those who are infertile and those who are fertile.\n\n3. **Spermiogram Analysis**: There was a noted higher rate of anomalous spermiograms in the nuclear power plant workers. However, it is important to note that these abnormalities were described as temporary. This indicates that while there may be some immediate effects on sperm quality, they do not appear to have a lasting impact.\n\n4. **Correlation with Radiation Dose**: The study found no correlation between the cumulative equivalent radiation dose and the occurrence of abnormal spermiograms. This suggests that the amount of radiation exposure does not directly influence sperm quality in a way that would affect fertility.\n\n5. **Conclusion on Conception and Pregnancy**: Given that there were no differences in exposure rates between the fertile and infertile groups, and that any observed sperm abnormalities were temporary and not correlated with radiation dose, it can be concluded that occupational exposure to radiation in this context does not have a significant effect on conception and pregnancy.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer to the question is:\n\n(B) no",
        "thinking": "The analysis reveals that occupational exposure to radiation does not have a significant effect on conception and pregnancy, as both groups showed similar exposure rates with temporary sperm abnormalities that were not dose-related.",

        "question": "We investigated the actual role of MRI versus arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, pain and severe functional impairment. Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography.\nWe retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression.\nWe identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent.\n\"Occult\" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy?",
        "answer": "yes",
        "answer_rationale": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.",

All patients underwent MRI and arthroscopy.\n\n2. **Types of Injuries Identified**: The study identified three types of occult injuries: bone bruises, subchondral injuries, and osteochondral injuries. MRI was able to detect these injuries based on specific signal patterns.\n\n3. **Arthroscopy Findings**: Arthroscopy revealed a higher number of osteochondral and chondral injuries compared to what MRI identified. Specifically, arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries, indicating that it was able to visualize more injuries than MRI.\n\n4. **Comparison of Diagnostic Capabilities**: While MRI can detect certain types of injuries (like bone bruises and some osteochondral injuries), the study suggests that arthroscopy is more comprehensive in identifying the full extent of injuries, particularly chondral injuries that MRI may miss.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that arthroscopy was able to identify more injuries than MRI, it indicates that MRI cannot fully substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in this context. Therefore, while MRI is a valuable tool, it does not replace the need for arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of all types of occult post-traumatic knee injuries.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(B) no",

        "question": "Uterus-specific synthetic Prostaglandin analogues (gemeprost, sulproston etc.) have been widely employed for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of labour.\n20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm.\nA median of 3 gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p<0.05). The requirement of Pethidin and the intensity of pain (measured by pain scale according to Huskisson) especially in the late first stage of labour were not statistically different between both groups. Side effects of paracervical anaesthesia did not occur.\nDoes para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?",

They were divided into two groups: one receiving only Pethidin and Butylscopolamine, and the other receiving these plus paracervical anaesthesia.\n\n2. **Induction to Abortion Interval**: The median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours for the group without paracervical anaesthesia and 13 hours for the group with it. However, the difference was not statistically significant (NS), indicating that while there was a shorter interval in the paracervical group, it was not enough to conclude that it was clinically meaningful.\n\n3. **Pain Management**: The requirement for Pethidin and the intensity of pain were not statistically different between the two groups, suggesting that paracervical anaesthesia did not significantly reduce pain during the procedure.\n\n4. **Butylscopolamine Requirement**: The requirement for Butylscopolamine was higher in the paracervical anaesthesia group, which could indicate that the anaesthesia did not effectively manage discomfort or that it had a different effect on the need for additional medication.\n\n5. **Side Effects**: There were no reported side effects from the paracervical anaesthesia, which is a positive aspect, but it does not necessarily indicate an advantage in terms of efficacy or pain management.\n\nBased on these points, while paracervical anaesthesia did not lead to a statistically significant reduction in the induction to abortion interval or pain levels, it also did not introduce side effects.
