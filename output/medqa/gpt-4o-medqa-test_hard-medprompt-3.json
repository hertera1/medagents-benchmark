His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient\u2019s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The treatment is administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle. This suggests the use of a drug that is used in the context of infertility and possibly related to hormonal regulation.\n\nOne such drug is a GnRH agonist or antagonist, which can be used to treat infertility by regulating the release of gonadotropins. When administered intermittently, it can help in conditions like endometriosis or uterine fibroids, which can affect fertility.\n\nIf a GnRH agonist or antagonist is administered continuously, it can suppress gonadotropin release, leading to decreased levels of sex hormones. This continuous administration is used in the treatment of prostate cancer, as it reduces testosterone levels, which can help in managing the cancer.\n\nTherefore, the condition that may also be treated by this drug when administered in a different manner is:\n\n(D) Prostate cancer"

On examination, a thyroid nodule was present; the nodule was fixed, immobile, and non-tender. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. Histological examination of a fine needle biopsy was performed and cytological examination reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia.

Her lab work shows a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 68 fl, indicating microcytic anemia.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The standard anti-tuberculosis regimen typically includes isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\n2. Isoniazid is known to cause vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency, which can lead to sideroblastic anemia.\n3. Sideroblastic anemia is characterized by microcytic anemia (low MCV) and can present with symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and weakness.\n4. Vitamin B6 is a cofactor for the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase, which is involved in heme synthesis.\n5. A deficiency in vitamin B6 leads to decreased ALA synthesis, resulting in impaired heme production and microcytic anemia.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of her current symptoms is:\n(D) Decreased ALA synthesis"

She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not \u201ckeeping up\u201d with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable.

Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain.

She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving.

        "question": "A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and \u2018bruising on his feet\u2019. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient\u2019s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?\n ",

The patient has had pain when urinating and difficulty starting a stream of urine for over 4 months now. He is bothered because he has to urinate about 9 times every day, including several times when he wakes up at night. A digital rectal examination revealed multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan shows a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. An ultrasound scan of his urinary bladder and prostate shows residual urine of > 200 mL and heterogeneous findings of the prostate gland. Biopsy reveals grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up 9 months later shows his prostate cancer is well controlled with goserelin.

The initial head CT shows diffuse atrophy but no acute findings.\n\nThe next step in management should focus on identifying the cause of the TIA and preventing future strokes. A CT angiogram can help evaluate the cerebral vasculature for any stenosis or occlusion that might have caused the TIA. An echocardiogram can assess for cardiac sources of emboli, especially given her history of atrial fibrillation. Heparin is not typically used in the acute setting of a TIA without evidence of ongoing ischemia or embolism. An MRI can provide detailed imaging of the brain to identify any small infarcts not seen on CT.\n\nGiven the acute presentation and the need to evaluate the cerebral vasculature, the best next step is:\n\n(A) CT angiogram",
