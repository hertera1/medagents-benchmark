        "raw_response": "To determine the range in which 95% of the population's intra-ocular pressure (IOP) would lie, we use the concept of standard deviation and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule) for a normal distribution. According to this rule, 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations from the mean.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean (\u03bc) = 25 mm Hg\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3) = 10 mm Hg\n\nThe range for 95% of the population is calculated as:\nMean \u00b1 2 * Standard deviation = 25 \u00b1 2 * 10 = 25 \u00b1 20\n\nTherefore, the range is:\n5 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this calculation. It seems there might be an error in the options or the question context. Based on the standard deviation provided, the correct range should be 5 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg, but this is not listed among the options.",
