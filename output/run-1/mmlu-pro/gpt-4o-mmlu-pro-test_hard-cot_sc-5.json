She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers.

We have multiple solutions provided, and each solution consistently identifies option (I) as the correct answer. \n\nTo evaluate the correctness of option (I), let's consider the process of fat digestion and absorption:\n\n1. **Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs)**: These are absorbed directly into the portal blood system. They are smaller and more water-soluble, allowing them to bypass the lymphatic system and enter the liver directly through the portal vein.\n\n2. **Long Chain Triglycerides (LCTs)**: These are absorbed into the lymphatic system. They are larger and less water-soluble, requiring packaging into chylomicrons to be transported via the lymphatic system before entering the bloodstream.\n\nOption (I) states: \"After absorption, long chain triglycerides (LCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas medium chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.\" This statement accurately reflects the physiological process of fat absorption, making it the correct choice.\n\nGiven the consistent identification of option (I) across all solutions, it is the most reliable answer.

This makes them more susceptible to protein-deficient diets.\n\n2. **Pregnant Women**: They have increased protein needs to support fetal development, but with proper dietary management, they are not the most susceptible to deficiency.\n\nGiven these considerations, the elderly are indeed more susceptible to protein-deficient diets due to various physiological and lifestyle factors.

This mechanism involves protecting oneself from criticism or negative feedback by rationalizing or justifying one's actions.\n\nAll solutions provided (Solution 1 through Solution 5) consistently identify option **C** as the answer.

The TMJ contains an articular disc made of fibrocartilage, which helps in smooth movement and acts as a cushion between the bones.\n\n- (B) Proprioceptive information is carried by the chorda tympani and deep temporal nerves: This is incorrect. The chorda tympani is primarily involved in taste sensation and parasympathetic innervation, not proprioception of the TMJ.\n\n- (C) It is a hinge type of synovial joint: This is partially true, but the TMJ is more accurately described as a ginglymoarthrodial joint, which means it has both hinge and sliding movements.\n\n- (D) Proprioceptive information is carried by the masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves: This is true. The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve, carries proprioceptive information from the TMJ.\n\n- (E) Proprioceptive information is carried by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves: This is incorrect. These nerves are not involved in proprioception of the TMJ.\n\n- (F) Its articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage: This is incorrect.

The TMJ is one of the few joints where the articular surfaces are covered by fibrocartilage.\n\n- (H) Proprioceptive information is carried by the facial and trigeminal nerves: This is partially true, as the trigeminal nerve is involved, but the facial nerve is not directly involved in TMJ proprioception.\n\n- (I) It has an articular disc of hyaline cartilage: This is incorrect.

This is a fundamental aspect of neuroanatomy, where the dorsal roots are responsible for carrying sensory information from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system.\n\nUpon evaluating the solutions provided, each solution consistently identifies \"I\" as the answer. This indicates that the dorsal roots contain sensory neuronal processes, which aligns with the established understanding of spinal nerve anatomy.\n\nTherefore, the most frequently appearing and consistent solution across all provided solutions is \"I\".",
