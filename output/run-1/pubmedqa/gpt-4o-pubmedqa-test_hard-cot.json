        "raw_response": "To determine whether double reading of barium enemas is necessary, we need to evaluate the findings from the study:\n\n1. **Increase in Positive Results**: Adding a second reader increased the number of positive results from 249 to 315, which is statistically significant (p<0.0001). This suggests that double reading can identify more cases that may require clinical intervention.\n\n2. **Clinical Impact**: The study notes that the addition of a second reader resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%). This indicates that double reading has a meaningful impact on clinical decision-making.\n\n3. **Sensitivity and Specificity**: The sensitivity for detecting all lesions remained the same at 76.3% for both single and combined readings. However, specificity decreased from 91.0% to 86.4% with the combined reading. This means that while more positive results were identified, there was a slight increase in false positives.\n\n4. **Agreement (Kappa Value)**: The kappa value, which measures agreement, decreased from 61.8% to 52.9% with the addition of a second reader. This suggests that while more lesions were detected, the consistency between readings decreased.\n\n5. **Time Requirement**: The second reading required an average of 3.3 minutes, which is relatively short and suggests that the process is feasible in terms of time.\n\n6. **Detection of Adenocarcinomas**: Sensitivity for detecting adenocarcinomas was 100%, indicating that double reading is highly effective for identifying these serious conditions.\n\nConsidering these points, the double reading of barium enemas increases the detection of positive results and has a significant clinical impact, despite a decrease in specificity and agreement. The feasibility in terms of time is also reasonable. Therefore, the benefits of potentially altering clinical treatment and ensuring the detection of serious conditions like adenocarcinomas suggest that double reading is beneficial.\n\nThus, the answer to whether double reading of barium enemas is necessary is:\n\n(A) yes",

The patients were more than 3 years old, and the surgeries were performed between 1995 and 2003.\n\n2. **Outcome Measures**: The study used a 15-item questionnaire to assess long-term outcomes, with scores ranging from 0 to 40. The scoring categories were: 0-10 (excellent), 11-20 (good), 21-30 (fair), and 31-40 (poor).\n\n3. **Statistical Analysis**: The study employed a 2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, and regression analyses to evaluate the data, ensuring a confidence interval higher than 95%.\n\n4. **Results**:\n   - **Overall Scores**: The overall scores between the TERPT and ABD groups were similar.\n   - **Continence Scores**: The ABD group had significantly better continence scores.\n   - **Stool Pattern Scores**: The TERPT group had better stool pattern scores.\n   - **Age Factor**: There was a significant difference in age at interview between the two groups, but controlling for age showed it did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The study found that while overall scores were similar, there were differences in specific areas: continence was better in the ABD group, and stool pattern was better in the TERPT group. This suggests that while the overall long-term results might be similar, there are differences in specific outcomes that could be important depending on the clinical priorities.\n\nGiven this analysis, the long-term results of the transanal pull-through are not entirely equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through due to differences in specific outcome measures (continence and stool pattern).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(B) no",

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\nMidwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",

Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group.

This suggests a correlation between the severity of vaginal lesions and cervical lesions, indicating that mild lesions in one area are associated with mild lesions in the other.\n\n2. **Active vs. Non-Active Lesions:**\n   - In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non-active\" cervical lesions. This suggests that the activity level of lesions in the vagina correlates with the activity level of lesions in the cervix.\n\n3. **High-Grade vs. Low-Grade VAIN:**\n   - The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant. This indicates that the severity of VAIN does not significantly correlate with the severity of CIN.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe study shows some correlation between the activity and severity of lesions in the vagina and cervix, but it does not establish a definitive parallel in their evolution. The lack of significant differences in cervical lesion severity among different grades of VAIN suggests that while there are similarities, the evolution of VAIN may not be identical to CIN.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia has the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is:\n\n(C) maybe",

A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.\nThe calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result.

Yet many clinicians are concerned about overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers.\nWe developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.\nExperts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001).

        "question": "A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored.\nAnticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients.\nIs there a role for fondaparinux in perioperative bridging?",

This long half-life makes timing of discontinuation before surgery critical, especially in surgeries with high bleeding risk or those involving neuraxial anesthesia.\n\n2. **Guidelines and Trials**: Anticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Published trials have used fondaparinux for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, but generally avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia.\n\n3. **Case Reports**: There are three case reports citing the use of fondaparinux as perioperative bridge therapy, with varying doses (2.5 mg and 7.5 mg). This suggests some clinical use, but not widespread or standardized.\n\n4. **Anesthesia Guidelines**: Professional anesthesia guidelines conflict regarding the timing of fondaparinux administration with neuraxial catheter use, indicating uncertainty and variability in practice.\n\n5. **Alternative Situations**: Fondaparinux may be considered in specific situations where other anticoagulants like low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin are not possible, contraindicated, or ineffective, such as in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.\n\nConsidering these points, fondaparinux does have a potential role in perioperative bridging, particularly in specific clinical scenarios where other anticoagulants are not suitable.

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

Various assessment tools were used, including the SCID I and II for psychiatric diagnoses, COPE for coping strategies, and NEO-FFI for personality traits.\n\n2. **Findings on Age and Symptomatology**: Older adults reported less symptomatology compared to younger patients. This suggests that age might influence the perception or reporting of psychiatric symptoms.\n\n3. **Findings on Personality Dysfunction**: Younger patients described more personality dysfunction than older patients. This indicates a potential age-related difference in personality pathology.\n\n4. **Coping Strategies**: Older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults, as assessed by the COPE. This suggests that age is associated with more adaptive coping strategies.\n\n5. **Predictors of Coping Strategies**: The study found that personality traits, social supports, gender, and age predicted coping strategies. However, Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom severity were not significant predictors.\n\n6. **Moderation by Age**: The question specifically asks if age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style. The study results indicate that personality disorder was not a significant predictor of coping strategies, while age was a predictor. This suggests that age might have a more direct influence on coping strategies rather than moderating the effect of personality disorder.\n\nBased on the information provided, age does not moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style because personality disorder itself was not a significant predictor of coping strategies. Instead, age directly influences coping strategies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) no",

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease.\nThe prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment.\nCoronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01).

        "question": "Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.\nA total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC\u2009>\u20091 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.002).

This suggests that MRSA strains are becoming less susceptible to vancomycin over time.\n\n2. **Study Context**: The study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal over a 3-year period (2007-2009). It assessed vancomycin MICs for MRSA isolates using the Etest method.\n\n3. **Results**: The study found that the majority of MRSA isolates had vancomycin MICs of 1.5 and 2 mg/L, with a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC > 1 mg/L over the years. However, no isolates had a MIC > 2 mg/L.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Study**: The study observed fluctuations in vancomycin MICs over the 3-year period, but it did not provide evidence of a consistent increase (creep) in MICs. Additionally, the study was limited to a single center in Portugal.\n\n5. **Global Perspective**: The question asks if vancomycin MIC creep is a worldwide phenomenon. The study provides localized data from one hospital in Portugal, which cannot be extrapolated to represent global trends. Other studies from different regions would be needed to determine if vancomycin MIC creep is occurring worldwide.\n\n6. **Answering the Question**: Given the localized nature of the study and the lack of global data presented, we cannot definitively say that vancomycin MIC creep is a worldwide phenomenon based solely on this study.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(C) maybe",

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records.

Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk.\nData from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.\nOne thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with \u22653 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98).\nIs digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate cancer?",

Controls were matched by age, which helps reduce confounding by age.\n\n3. **Exposure Assessment**: Digoxin use was determined through in-person questionnaires, which can provide reliable data on medication history.\n\n4. **Statistical Analysis**: Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between digoxin use and prostate cancer risk, adjusting for confounders such as age, race, PSA screening, and family history of prostate cancer.\n\n5. **Results**:\n   - **Overall Analysis**: Digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of prostate cancer (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). This suggests a potential protective effect, but the confidence interval includes 1.0, indicating that the result is not statistically significant.\n   - **Subgroup Analysis**: Among those with \u22653 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years, digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction in prostate cancer risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98). This result is statistically significant as the confidence interval does not include 1.0.\n\n6. **Interpretation**: The overall analysis suggests a possible reduction in prostate cancer risk with digoxin use, but the lack of statistical significance means we cannot definitively say there is an association. However, the subgroup analysis among those with frequent PSA testing shows a statistically significant reduction in risk, suggesting that digoxin may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer in this specific group.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given the mixed results, with a significant finding in a subgroup but not overall, the association between digoxin use and prostate cancer risk is not definitive. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(C) maybe\n\nThis reflects the uncertainty and the need for further research to clarify the relationship.",

Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police.

This suggests that the effectiveness of treatment does not significantly differ across these age groups.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Despite the effectiveness of treatment in improving survival, there is a notable increase in the number of elderly patients who do not receive treatment. This suggests that elderly patients may be undertreated, as they are less likely to receive beneficial therapies despite the potential for improved survival.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether the elderly with oropharyngeal carcinoma are undertreated is:\n\n(A) yes",
        "thinking": "The analysis indicates that elderly patients are increasingly not receiving treatment for oropharyngeal carcinoma despite evidence that treatment improves survival. This suggests they are indeed undertreated.",

        "question": "Concussions are commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management.\nA prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit.\nA total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p<0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most (58%) did not receive medical clearance. Of the patients who had returned to activities at 4 weeks (64%), less than one quarter (23%) were symptomatic, and most (54%) received medical clearance.\nAre pediatric concussion patients compliant with discharge instructions?",

Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40\u2005min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2\u2005weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.\nInterviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.\nOverall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant.

The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS.\nTo receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged \u226565 years received social assistance in 2009.

The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion.\nIn this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.\nThe sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm. The thickness tended to decrease with the increase in insertion angle from 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.

Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test.\nFor T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08).

        "question": "Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up.\nTreatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?",

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor.

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects.\nWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes.\nThe total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005).

This indicates some level of airway inflammation, as eosinophils are a marker of inflammation.\n\n2. **Blood Leukocyte Count**:\n   - All asthma phenotypes, including paucigranulocytic asthma, showed increased blood leukocyte counts compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). This suggests systemic inflammation.\n\n3. **Blood Eosinophils**:\n   - Paucigranulocytic asthmatics had increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophils are typically associated with inflammatory processes.\n\n4. **Systemic Inflammatory Markers**:\n   - The study does not mention specific systemic inflammatory markers for paucigranulocytic asthma, but the increased blood eosinophils and leukocytes suggest systemic inflammation.\n\nBased on these observations, even though paucigranulocytic asthma might have fewer granulocytes in the sputum compared to other phenotypes, the presence of increased eosinophils in both sputum and blood, along with increased blood leukocytes, indicates that there is still an inflammatory process occurring.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that paucigranulocytic asthmatics are not truly non-inflammatory, as they exhibit signs of inflammation both in the airways and systemically.\n\nThe answer is (B) no.",

This procedure carries a risk of anastomotic leakage, which can lead to serious complications such as infection, sepsis, and the need for reoperation.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**: The study includes 43 major colorectal procedures on 37 women, with the most common being low rectal resection. Only 3 patients (8%) had a diverting loop ileostomy, which is a type of stoma used to divert fecal matter and reduce pressure on the anastomosis site, potentially lowering the risk of leakage.\n\n3. **Outcome Consideration**: The primary outcome of interest is anastomotic leakage. The presence of a diverting stoma is typically used to mitigate this risk. The data does not provide specific leakage rates or outcomes for patients with and without a stoma, but the low number of diverting stomas suggests that most anastomoses were performed without one.\n\n4. **Safety Assessment**: Without specific leakage rates, we must rely on general surgical principles and the fact that diverting stomas are often used to enhance safety by reducing leakage risk. The absence of a diverting stoma could increase the risk of leakage, which is a significant concern in colorectal surgery.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the potential risks associated with anastomotic leakage and the protective role of a diverting stoma, it is generally considered safer to perform rectal anastomosis with a diverting stoma, especially in complex surgeries like gynecological debulking.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether it is safe to perform rectal anastomosis without a diverting stoma is:\n\n(B) no",

All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression.\nWe identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images.
