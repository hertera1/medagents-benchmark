However, the study also utilized a variety of other scales to assess different dimensions of health and quality of life, including emotional well-being, general health, and social participation.\n\nThe correlation coefficients provided in the study indicate varying degrees of relationship between the Barthel Index and other measures. For instance, the Barthel Index showed a strong correlation with the physical functioning dimension of the SF36 (r = 0.810) and the Frenchay activities index (r = 0.826), suggesting that it is a good indicator of physical capabilities. However, it had weaker correlations with emotional and psychological measures, such as the role emotional dimension of the SF36 (r = 0.217) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (r = -0.563).\n\nGiven that the Barthel Index primarily assesses physical disability, it does not encompass the full spectrum of outcomes relevant to stroke patients, particularly in terms of emotional and psychological well-being.

Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures.\nWe searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).\nUnlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining.

In normal conditions, Bcl-2 would inhibit apoptosis, while Bax promotes it. The observed increase in Bax could indicate a shift towards apoptosis, but the presence of Bcl-2 in some neurons complicates this interpretation.\n\n2. **Caspase Activity**: The detection of fractin, which indicates caspase activity, suggests that some apoptotic processes may be occurring. However, the fact that only about 10% of neurons showed this activity raises questions about the overall mechanism of cell death.\n\n3. **TUNEL Staining**: The TUNEL method is used to detect DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. The absence of DNA fragmentation in the samples suggests that the cell death observed is not typical of apoptosis, despite the presence of pro-apoptotic signals.\n\n4. **Nuclear Morphology**: The lack of typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology further supports the conclusion that the cell death is not apoptotic.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence suggests that while there are indicators of apoptotic processes (like increased Bax and caspase activity), the definitive markers of apoptosis (DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphology changes) are absent.

However, without some form of standardized methodology between laboratories, the correlation of results is difficult.\nUsing TaqMan-based assays, parallel quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed on 70 clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University. While the same positive control cell line (K562) and quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were different.\nThe detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p<0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory.\nBCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR : are correlated results possible from homebrew assays?",

The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2.

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\nMidwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",

Here are the key points from the findings:\n\n1. **Competence Reporting**: While both groups reported similar overall competence, there were significant differences in specific competencies. Rural midwives reported higher competence in breech delivery, while urban midwives reported higher competence in skills like intravenous fluid replacement and newborn examinations.\n\n2. **Continuing Professional Development**: Both groups faced barriers to continuing education, but rural midwives had a higher attendance rate at educational events recently, indicating a proactive approach to maintaining their skills.\n\n3. **Barriers to Training**: Urban midwives reported lack of time as a greater barrier, while rural midwives faced challenges related to distance to training. Urban midwives also showed higher levels of lack of motivation or interest.\n\nGiven these points, it can be inferred that working in a rural location does indeed affect midwives' competence in certain areas, as evidenced by the differences in reported competencies and the barriers they face.

        "question": "Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1.\nDoes the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?",

Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.\nThe calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02).\nCan calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?",

In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001). Experts only rated celiac sprue screening and complete blood count as appropriate in D-IBS; nonexperts rated most tests as appropriate.

Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates.

The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold.\nDoes combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?",

The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was reported as 0.085, but this difference was not statistically significant. This indicates that while there was a slight increase in utility (which is a measure of quality of life), it was not enough to be considered statistically meaningful.\n\n2. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**: The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) for FXD over FRC was $45,540.49 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that FXD has a greater than 50% probability of being cost-effective above a $40,000 threshold. However, this does not directly imply an enhancement in quality of life, but rather a cost-effectiveness perspective.\n\n3. **Conclusion on Quality of Life**: Since the increase in utility was not statistically significant, we cannot definitively conclude that combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhances the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease.\nThe prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment.\nCoronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs. In this subpopulation of 47 patients, the prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT reached 19.2 %.\nShould HIV-infected patients be screened for silent myocardial ischaemia using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT?",

The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.\nA total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively.

        "question": "Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.\nAre women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?",

The findings indicate that:\n\n1. **Dispensing Records**: 4.6% of pregnant women had at least one antidepressant dispensed.\n2. **Hospital Admission Records**: 3.1% of women had a comorbidity related to depression recorded during their hospital admissions.\n3. **Overlap**: Only 13.6% of the cases were identified in both datasets, meaning that a significant number of women who were dispensed antidepressants did not have depression recorded in their hospital records (80%).\n\nThe key takeaway from this data is that while there are methods to identify women with major depression in pregnancy through health data, the overlap between the two datasets is limited. This suggests that many women with depression may not be captured accurately in population health data due to the reliance on different sources of information that do not consistently identify the same individuals.\n\nGiven that the majority of women who were dispensed antidepressants did not have a corresponding record of depression in hospital admissions, it indicates that the identification of women with major depression in pregnancy is not fully reliable or comprehensive in the available population health data.\n\nThus, the answer to the question of whether women with major depression in pregnancy are identifiable in population health data is \"no,\" as the data linkage and ascertainment methods do not capture all cases effectively.\n\nNow, evaluating the solutions provided:\n- All five solutions consistently answer \"B\" (no).\n\nSince all solutions agree on the same answer, the most consistent solution is \"B.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nB",

Furthermore, it highlights that more severely injured patients tend to be in areas with high police-recorded crimes.\n\nGiven this context, the implication is that ambulance data could provide valuable insights into areas of violence that are not fully captured by police data alone. By sharing this data, both agencies could potentially identify and address hotspots of violence more effectively, leading to a reduction in community violence.\n\nNow, looking at the solutions provided:\n- All five solutions consistently indicate \"A\" (yes) as the answer to whether routinely collected ambulance data about assaults can contribute to the reduction in community violence.\n\nThis unanimous agreement across all solutions suggests a strong consensus that the ambulance data can indeed play a role in reducing community violence, likely due to the insights it can provide into the locations and circumstances of violent incidents.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent solution is:\n\nA",

Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.\nSchanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology (p>0.8).\nIs portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments?",

Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40\u2005min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2\u2005weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.\nInterviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.\nOverall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.\nDo parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?",

The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS.\nTo receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged \u226565 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged \u226565 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p<0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education.\nDoes government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals?",

Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test.\nFor T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity. For N staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (92%) than MRI and MDCT (69 and 73%; p = 0.01 and p = 0.02).

As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions.\nThis study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden.\nThe Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.\nThe Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001).\nDo Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms?",

The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion.

It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis.

The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were analysed.\nMean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, respectively, 2.23 \u00b1 1.4, 6.39 \u00b1 6.6, and 31.85 \u00b1 36.06 Gy. Significant differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered dose was decreased by 1.43 \u00b1 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95.

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor.

In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent.\n\"Occult\" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy?",
        "answer": "yes",
        "answer_rationale": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.",

        "ensemble_response": "To determine the most reliable solution to the question of whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in detecting occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee, we need to analyze the information provided in the study.\n\nThe study indicates that MRI was used to identify three types of occult injuries: bone bruises, subchondral injuries, and osteochondral injuries. While MRI can detect certain types of injuries, the results also show that arthroscopy was able to depict a greater number of osteochondral and chondral injuries than MRI. Specifically, arthroscopy identified 45 osteochondral injuries and 19 chondral injuries, while MRI identified 25 bone bruises, 33 subchondral injuries, and 35 osteochondral injuries. \n\nThe key takeaway from the study is that while MRI is useful in identifying certain injuries, it does not fully replace the need for arthroscopy, which provides a more comprehensive view of the knee joint and can identify additional injuries that MRI may miss. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from the study suggests that MRI cannot substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy.\n\nGiven that all five solutions provided the answer \"B\" (no), this indicates a strong consensus among the solutions. \n\nThus, the most consistent solution is:\n\nB",

        "question": "Uterus-specific synthetic Prostaglandin analogues (gemeprost, sulproston etc.) have been widely employed for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of labour.\n20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm.\nA median of 3 gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p<0.05). The requirement of Pethidin and the intensity of pain (measured by pain scale according to Huskisson) especially in the late first stage of labour were not statistically different between both groups. Side effects of paracervical anaesthesia did not occur.\nDoes para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?",
